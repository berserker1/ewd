<H2>Trip report E.W. Dijkstra, Europe, 13.12.1985 &#150; 10.1.1986</H2> 
<P>To start with a few advices to the airline passenger.</P> 

<OL start=0>
<li>If your ticket is a few months old, check well in advance that the schedule 
has not been changed. When we arrived at Austin Airport in the expectation that 
Eastern Airlines would take us to Atlanta, we learned that Eastern Airlines had 
pulled out of Austin. Fortunately we were early enough to catch an earlier flight 
by Delta Airlines, which honoured our tickets. It was an unpleasant surprise 
to start our journey with. </li>

<li>Don't book a KLM flight for Friday the 13<SUP>th</SUP> in the hope that the plane 
will be occupied below average: you will find the plane fully booked with passengers 
that harboured the same hope.</li> 

<li>Avoid departing from or arriving at Welschap with small planes like the F27 in those months when the runway could be covered with snow, sleet, or ice; 
I had three of such flights, only the last of which was actually consumed.</li> 

<li>If you can enter the USA via Atlanta, do it. We walked from the gate to 
the belt and by the time we arrived there, the luggage was already coming in. 
It was fantastic. Immigration and customs were equally smooth. The official 
91 minutes we had to change planes had been reduced to 71 by late arrival but 
we had plenty of time to catch our connection. </li>

<li>If you can choose a British Airways flight leaving Schiphol around noon, 
do it: the food was really excellent.</li> 

<li>In the same vein I should suggest to avoid leaving the USA by KLM; 
catering for those flights is not up to par. </li>
</OL>

<P>So much for my advices to the airline passenger.</P>

<P>After a thorough cleaning of the house, followed by a poisoning of all possible insect entrances, we left on Friday the 13th of December 1985 and arrived the next morning at 9:55 at Schiphol, where our daughter was waiting for us with a car. It was a foggy day.</P> 

<P>We used the weekend for recovery as, on Monday, life would start in real 
earnest. Ria went that day by train to Amsterdam to greet her mother, while 
I was interviewed most of that day by a Mexican student from the University of 
Edinburgh who wrote a thesis on the history of software development.</P> 

<P>On Tuesday, Ria and I drove, mostly in heavy rain, to Groningen at the 
other side of the country in order to attend the inaugural lecture by 
Jan L.A. van de Snepscheut, a lecture we very much enjoyed. That night we stayed 
with Femke, as she would graduate the next morning at the Department of Slavonic 
Languages. After the formality, she and a colleague offered their guests a nice 
breakfast by way of celebration. Around noon we left and drove to Nuenen, again mostly in heavy rain. South of
the village Veghel, the cable of the clutch of the 
rental car broke. Thanks to the proximity of the garage where we had rented 
it and the kind assistance of a young lady that saw us getting stuck and offered 
her assistance, the delay was no longer than an hour. It was, however, raining 
cats and dogs, and we got accordingly wet. </P>

<P>On Thursday I went to the Eindhoven University of Technology, where I gave 
a talk at its recently founded Informatics Colloquium. I had a nice crowd and 
explained Battcher's Baffler, which by now is a very beautiful story. It was 
well-received. </P>

<P>And on Friday we went up North again, to Zutphen, where we celebrated my 
mother's 85th anniversary with a lunch in the IJsselrestaurant. That was the 
first time I met my mother and my sister, and on this trip the only time I met 
my brother and his wife. It was nice to see them all again; we did not stay 
too long as pretty foul weather had been predicted for the evening. </P>

<P>And so on, and so on. I worked only twice with 
Carel S. Scholten
and only 
twice with Netty van Gasteren and attended only one session of the Eindhoven 
Tuesday Afternoon Club (on 31.12.1985). It was a nice session; we read 
AvG65/EWD950
"On notation" and collected helpful &#x2014;and encouraging!&#x2014; comments. And 
besides all that we did the usual things, visited the children and received them, 
had friends for dinner and were invited for dinner, etc. And occasionally we 
did nothing at all. We did not make much use of our bicycles, for in the night 
of 26/27 Dec. it started to snow, instantaneously transforming the whole country into one big

Christmas card. So Ria and I put on our rubber boots and made a 
series of beautiful pictures in the immediate surroundings of Nuenen. It was 
unbelievable! </P>

<P>The winter will, however, go down into the Books of History as "The Winter 
in which We Found the Old Mont Blancs". I love my Mont Blanc but for many years 
am aware of the fact that the company stopped making this model about 
a decade it is the model with the built-in pump that takes much more ink 
than its replacement, which accepts cartridges as well. Since it is nice to 
have a spare, it has become second nature for me to try new models whenever I 
encounter them. One afternoon I went to the village stationery shop to buy European 
staples, saw a new Mont Blanc,

tried it and did not like it, when the saleslady 
behind the counter said with great hesitation "When you 

object to using 
an ink pot, I have another model, but it is very old.....". The dear soul sold 
me her treasure for the original price. After that find Ria suggested that we 
should try that 

other branch in Someren, where Netty van Gasteren and Wim Feijen
bought the remaining three copies. They too still had their original 
price tags and were even cheaper; on top of that they even got 
fl. 10,-
discount 
per pen! So much for the stationery shops in little Brabantian villages. </P>

<P>The last Monday, Netty and I flew to England to give a workshop for BP. 
For safety's sake we went to by train instead of by air. The 
flight to was okay, but from there on everything seemed to go wrong. 
We arrived at Terminal 1, while Don Braben tried to collect us from Terminal 

2. After Netty had contacted him by paging, we thought the problem had been 
solved but then the one confusion piled upon the other and eventually it took 
almost two hours to sort out that mess. </P>

<P>The workshop was held in the hotel "The Spread Eagle" in Midhurst where 
it was frequently as cold as the hotel was old. I slept &#x2014;at least: tried to 
do so&#x2014; in "The Queen's Suite", distinguished by a four-poster and a closet for 
powdered wigs (or wig powder, I don't remember) dating from 1430 A.D.. But apart 

from such minor inconveniences, the workshop was quite successful, the more so 
since we succeeded in flying back home on Wednesday evening. With Netty's Dick 
and my Ria and Femke we celebrated the happy reunions with a late Indonesian/Chinese dinner at Kota Radja

opposite to the railway station. On Thursday we 
packed, in the evening a number of friends came by to say goodbye and on Friday 
morning Femke drove us with all our luggage to Welschap: this time we could 
use the small airport. At 19.55 local time we landed in Austin; we took a taxi 
and shortly thereafter we were home again. Not counting a dozen 
dead
insects 
on the floor &#x2014;and no scorpions this time!&#x2014; we found the house at Robbie Creek 
Cove in perfect condition.</P>

<P>Europe is not happy these days. I found a lot of tension and envy. (The 
latter is probably the price to be paid for its prevailing egalitarianism.)
By way of protest the Dutch truck drivers blocked a number of border posts and 
traffic junctions; when we arrived at Heathrow, the English taxi drivers were 
on strike; one participant of the workshop arrived a day late, due to a strike 
of the French air traffic controllers; and I never saw so many armoured cars 
and fully armed soldiers guarding the air ports. And at the Universities &#x2014;at 
both sides of the North 
Sea&#x2014; 
people are beginning to feel themselves so much 
betrayed by their governments that it is often hard not to get bitter. On paper 
there are still plenty of funds for informatics, but as that money has been ear-
marked to work miracles it only promotes quackery. Tension and envy, and each 
proposal being wrapped up in more and more layers of dishonesty. Europe is not happy these days. </P>

<P>Needless to say, I bought myself a typewriter the other day, a Triumph/ 
"satellite III".

It is electronic and in its more advanced features 
so user-friendly that the corresponding sections in the (46-page!) manual are 
utterly baffling. So far, the alphabet works. </P>
