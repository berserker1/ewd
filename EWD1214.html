  <h1>The marriage agency</h1>
  <div class='body'>
<p>A marriage agency has in its files 25 men and 25 women and aims at acquainting the men with the women by organising dinner evenings, each one involving 12 tables, seating 2 men and 2 women. (Consequently, at each dinner evening, 1 man and 1 woman have a day off.) The question is how many of such dinner evenings the marriage agency can schedule without some man and woman sharing a table twice.</p>

<p>Frans van der Sommen raised this problem at the end of the ETAC session of 8 August 1995. Rutger M. Dijkstra, who happened to attend that session, immediately showed how to schedule 12 dinner evenings: partition the men into a singleton and 12 pairs numbered [0...12), do the same with the women, and let on the <var>n</var>th evening the men of pair <var>i</var> share a table with the women of pair (<var>i</var>+<var>n</var>) <u>mod</u> 12.</p>
<p>The demonstration that 12 is indeed the maximum took a litle bit longer. Consider a sequence of 13 dinner evenings. Then at most 13 men have had an evening off, and therefore at least 12 (= 25 - 13) men dined all 13 evenings. Such a man enjoyed 26 (= 2 &#x00D7; 13) times the company of a woman; the number of women being 25, there is &#x2014;pigeon-hole principle&#x2014; at least one woman whose company he enjoyed at least twice. [As said, this took a little bit longer. We first tried too crude a counting argument in terms of man-woman combinations. Their total number is 625 (= 25 &#x00D7; 25), each evening 48 (= 4 &#x00D7; 12) combinations are getting acquainted. Since 625/48 = 13+1/48, this rules out a schedule of 14 or more evenings, but the feasibility of a schedule of 13 dinner evenings it leaves open.]</p>
<p>This is actually a sequel to <a title="PDF scan of EWD 1212" href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/ewd12xx/EWD1212.PDF">EWD1212</a>: feasibility is shown by means of a witness, infeasibility by a counting argument.</p>
