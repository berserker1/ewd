						<td align="left" valign="top">Richard Conway, David Gries, &quot;An Introduction to Programming&quot; (Winthrop Publishers Inc., 1973) paperback, 460 pp. $??.??. More than 220 pages are devoted to the description of the idiosyncrasies of the programming language of their choice, leading to complicated treatment of simple problems, compared to Dijkstra's simple treatment of complicated problems.<br>
							Niklaus Wirth, &quot;Systematic Programming: An Introduction&quot; (Prentice-Hall, 1973), hard cover, 167 pp. $??.??. Only one sixth (25 pp) of this book deals explicitly with the act of programming, and much of its space is devoted to truly introductory material, in contrast to Dijkstra's more advanced treatment that does not deal with things such as number systems, the ASCII character code, etc., which can be found in any other book on computers and programming.</td>
