<h1>A beautiful proof of a probably useless theorem</h1>
<div class='body'></h1>			<p>by<br />			Edsger W.Dijkstra and <abbr title="Wim">W.H.J.</abbr>Feijen</p>		</center>			<p>Let a positive continuous function be defined on the Euclidean plane, such that its integral taken over the whole plane is finite, say = 1. Then there exists a set of rectangular axes such that the four integrals of the function, taken over the four quadrants respectively, are all equal to each other.</p> 			<p>For a fixed orientation of the cross we can first move it in a direction perpendicular to one axis, such that eventually the surface integrals taken over the half planes at both sides of that one axis are equal to each other, a state of affairs that is not destroyed by moving thereafter the cross in a direction perpendicular to the other axis until also for that other axis the surface integrals at both sides are equal to each other. Such a so-called &quot;balanced position&quot; always exists and is uniquely determined by the orientation of the cross because the function integrated is positive. In a balanced position the surface integrals taken over opposite quadrants are equal: if they are both &#x00BC; + <var>&#x03B1;</var>, then the other two must each be &#x00BC; - <var>&#x03B1;</var>.</p>			<p>While keeping the relation &quot;the cross is in a balanced position&quot; invariant, the cross is now slowly rotated. The continuously changing value of the surface integral, taken over the quadrant encompassed by two chosen half-axes, that was originally = &#x00BC; + <var>&#x03B1;</var>, must have been at least once = &#x00BC; before we have rotated the cross over more than a right angle, for after a rotation over a right angle the cross has returned to its original balanced position, in which the continuously observed surface integral has the value &#x00BC; - <var>&#x03B1;</var>.</p> 		</div>			<br>			<br>			<br>			<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="0">				<tr>					<td valign="top"><abbr title ="doctor">dr.</abbr>Edsger W.Dijkstra<br />						BURROUGHS<br />						Plataanstraat 5<br />						NUENEN - 4565<br />						The Netherlands</td>					<td valign="top"><abbr title="ingenieur">ir.</abbr><abbr title="Wim">W.H.J.</abbr>Feijen<br />									Department of Mathematics<br />									Technological University<br />									P.O.Box 513<br />									Eindhoven<br />									The Netherlands</td>				</tr>			</table>			<div>				<p class="rightalign"></p>			</div>			<div id="footer">			<hr />			transcribed by Alejandro Ruiz<br /> 			revised <csobj format="MedDate" h="15" region="15" t="DateTime" w="111">Wed, 12 Nov 2008</csobj>		</div>		</div></body></html></div>
