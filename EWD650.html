<p class=noindent><b>A theorem about odd powers of odd integers</b>.
<p class=noindent><b>Theorem</b>. For any odd p &ge; 1 , integer K &ge; 1 , and odd r such that
that 1 &le; r &lt; 2<sup>K</sup>, a value x exists such that
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
R:</td><td>1 &le; x &lt; 2<sup>K</sup> <b>and</b> 2<sup>K</sup>|(x<sup>p</sup>-r) <b>and</b> odd(x) .
</td>  </tr>  </table>
<b>Note</b>. For &ldquo;a|b&rdquo; read: &ldquo;a divides b&rdquo;. (End of note.)
<p class=noindent><b>Proof</b>. The existence of x is proved by designing a program computing x
satisfying R .
<p>Trying to establish R by means of a repetitive construct, we must
choose an invariant relation. This time we apply the well-known technique
of replacing a constant by a variable, and replace the constant K by the
variable k . Introducing d = 2k for the sake of brevity, we then get
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
P:</td><td>d = 2<sup>k</sup> <b>and</b> 1 &le; x &lt; d <b>and</b> d|(x<sup>p</sup>-r) <b>and</b> odd(x) .
</td>  </tr>  </table>
This choice of invariant relation P is suggested by the observation that
R is trivial to satisfy for K 1; hence P is trivial to establish
initially. The simplest structure to try for our program is therefore:
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
     x, k, d :=1, 1, 2 {P};                                                                        </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>
     <b>do</b> k &ne; K &rarr; &ldquo;increase k by 1 under invariance of F&rdquo; <b>od</b> {R} . </td> </tr>
</table>
Increasing k by 1 (together with doubling d ) can only violate the
term d|(x<sup>p</sup>-r) . The weakest precondition that d:= 2*d does <b>not</b> do so
is &mdash;according to the axiom of assignment&mdash; (2*d)|(x<sup>p</sup>-r) . Hence an
acceptable component for &ldquo;increase k by 1 under invariance of P&rdquo;
is
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
</td><td> (2*d)|(x<sup>p</sup>-r) &rarr; k, d := k+1, 2*d .
</td>  </tr>  </table>
In the case <b>non</b> (2*d)l(x<sup>p</sup>-r) we conclude from d|(x<sup>p</sup>-r) that x<sup>p</sup>-r is
an odd multiple of d . Because d is even, and p and x are odd, the
binomial expansion tells us that (x+d)<sup>p</sup>-x<sup>p</sup> is an odd multiple of d
and that hence (x+d)<sup>p</sup>-r is a multiple of 2*d . Because also d is 
doubled, x &lt; d remains true under x:= x+d , because d is even odd(x) obviously
remains true, and our program becomes:

<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; </td> <td colspan = 3>
 x, k, d := 1, 1, 2 {P};                                                                     </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td colspan = 3>
 <b>do</b> k &ne; K &rarr; <b>if</b> (2*d)|(x<sup>p</sup>-r) &rarr; k, d := k+1, 2*d {P}                   </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
             &#x25af; <b>non</b> (2*d)|(x<sup>p</sup>-r) &rarr; x, k, d := x+d, k+1, 2*d {P} </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td colspan = 2>
           <b>fi</b> {P}                                                                     </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td colspan = 3>
 <b>od</b> {R}                                                                               </td> </tr>
</table>
Because this program obviously terminates, its existence proves the theorem.
(End of proof.) 
<p align="center" class="noindent">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>*</p> 
<p>With the argument as given, the above program was found in five minutes.
I only mention this in reply to Zohar Manna and Richard Waldinger, who wrote
in &ldquo;Synthesis: Dreams &rArr; Programs&rdquo; (SR1 Technical Note 156, November 1977)
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
</td><td>&ldquo;Our instructors at the Structured Programming School have urged us
to find the appropriate invariant assertion before introducing a loop.
But how are we to select the successful invariant when there are so
many promising candidates around? [...] Recursion seems to be the ideal
vehicle for systematic program construction [...]. In choosing to
emphasize iteration instead, the proponents of structured programming
have had to resort to more dubious (sic!) means.&rdquo;
</td>  </tr>  </table>
<p>Although I haven&rsquo;t used the term Structured Programming any more for at least
  five years, and although I have a vested interest in recursion, yet I felt
  addressed by the two gentlemen. So it seemed only appropriate to record that
  the &ldquo;more dubious means&rdquo; have &mdash;again!&mdash; been pretty effective. (I have
  evidence that, despite the existence of this very simple solution, the problem
  is not trivial: many computing scientists could not solve the programming
  problem within an hour. Try it on your colleagues, if you don&rsquo;t believe me.)</p>
