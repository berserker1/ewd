<h1>Computing Science in the United Kingdom</h1>
<div class='body'>
				<p>This is just a sad reminder that in the Old World not all is well, not even in the United Kingdom that has so often been leading in Computing Science.</p>
				<p>In the <i>Computing Newsletter</i>, October 1986 &#x2014;a publication of The British Computer Society&#x2014; I encountered in an article titled &ldquo;Second Manchester Conference on Careers with Computers. Are we Getting it Right&rdquo; by Geoff Hayes the following:</p>
				<p class="noindent" style="margin-left: 2em;">&ldquo;From returned questionnaires attempting to gauge interest and relevance, the conference was a singular success, especially as it has also highlighted some significant differences of needs as perceived by educators and employers. Many delegates found this profoundly disturbing [...].&rdquo;</p>
				<p class="noindent">But the discrepancy between what the world asks for and what the world needs has been computing&rsquo;s traditional curse for more than a quarter of a century! That &ldquo;many delegates&rdquo; can still be surprised when faced with a manifestation of this fact, well, that&rsquo;s what I think rather disturbing....</p>
				<p>In<i> The Computer Journal</i>, Vol.29 No.5, October 1986 &#x2014;the most prestigious publication of The British Computer Society&#x2014; I found in an article titled &ldquo;A Knowledge-Engineering Approach to Instructional Design&rdquo; by Nick Rushby the following revealing diagram:</p>
				<p class="noindent" align="center"><img src="EWD997_fig2.png" alt="EWD997 figure 2"  title="EWD997 figure 2" /></p>
				<p>For those who think this insufficiently baroque, the text adds: &ldquo;This shows some of the possible topics and linkages: readers are encouraged to add their own as they read through this paper and further ideas occur to them.&rdquo;.</p>
				<p class="noindent">Another sentence from that paper to be conserved for posteriority is: &ldquo;Clearly, there is a need for a better understanding of the learning process, and a need for a language with which to describe it.&rdquo;.</p>
				<p>That same issue of <i>The Computer Journal</i> contains a nice specimen of junk science: IBMology. It is the paper titled &ldquo;IBM makes usability as important as functionality&rdquo; by B.Shackel. In its first column it contains what we have to consider an educated guess &ldquo;In my opinion the decision for usability and human factors was probably taken at the same time.&rdquo;; in its second column the author gets really scientific: &ldquo;A corporate decision must have been made in 1980 or early 1981, with substantial funding assigned to various programmes. The result, below, provide the evidence.&rdquo;. I always thought the &ldquo;Phenomena breed science&rdquo; of Newell, Perlis, and Simon (1967) a bit superficial; the Shackel paper is what we get when the dictum is taken to heart.</p>
				<p>It is a sad world.</p>
