  <p>For the integer function m(x, y) of the integer arguments x and y , given by
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%>  </td><td valign=top>
m(x,y) = (x &ge; y &rarr; x+1 &#x25af; x &lt; y &rarr; y-1)</td><td align=right>(1)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
it is required to prove that
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%>  </td><td valign=top>
(x = y &rarr; y+1 &#x25af; x &ne; y &rarr; m(x, m(x-1, y+1))) = m(x, y)</td><td align=right>(2).
</td>  </tr>  </table>
<p class=noindent><b>Proof</b>. From (1) follows that the first alternative in the left-hand side of
(2) may be replaced by x = y &rarr; m(x, y) ; the proof is complete when we show
that the second alternative can be replaced by x &ne; y &rarr; m(x, y) . This letter
replacement is allowed as we shall prove
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%>  </td><td valign=top>
m(x, m(x-1, y+1)) = m(x, y)</td><td align=right>(3)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
From (1) follows
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%>  </td><td valign=top>
X &ge; y &rArr; (m(x, x) = m(x, y))</td><td align=right>(4)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
From (1) it also follows that the only possible values of m(x-1, y+1) are
x and y . If m(x-1, y+1) = y , (3) holds trivially. Otherwise we have
m(x-1, y+1) &ne; y , which implies &mdash;on account of (1)&mdash;
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%>  </td><td valign=top>
m(x-1, y+1) = x and x-1 &ge; y+1 .</td><td align=right>(5)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
As (5) implies x &ge; y , we conclude by (4) and (5) that (3) then holds as
well. (End of proof.)
<p>The above proof has been given, because 33(!) lines of formal text, as
dedicated to a proof of this theorem in said Arbeitsblatt 3, is to our tastes
a bit unwieldy. We appreciate that the proof in said Arbeitsblatt 3 has been
conducted in terms of a limited repertoire of operations that seem suitable
for mechanization. When, however, the length of such proofs and their obvious
tedium are presented &mdash;as is often the case&mdash; as conclusive evidence for the
necessity of such mechanizations, it should be clear that at least the above
example has failed to convince us of such necessity.
