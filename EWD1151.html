<p>Due to a conference on discrete algorithms, held here in town, the Department is flooded by speakers that "are in Austin anyhow". This morning, we had a speaker on the —I guess asymptotic— complexity of scheduling divide-and-conquer algorithms on a hypercube machine. He tried to convey his message via a mixture of sentences, gesticulations, formulae, and pictures; the design of a "language" adequate for the presentation of his material seemed to me to be his most urgent task. The end of his talk was particularly unintelligible; here I confine myself to something I saw earlier.</p>
<p>I had noticed that in almost all his formulae "<var>p</var>" occurred in the combination "log <var>p</var>", so that his formulae could be shortened by expressing them in <var>y</var> instead, with <var>y</var> and <var>p</var> linked by "<var>y</var>&nbsp;=&nbsp;log <var>p</var>". But then he showed the formula —well, not really!—</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="noindent">log <var>p</var> log log<sup><var>x</var></sup> <var>p</var></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="noindent">Could this be expressed in <var>y</var> ? And, if so, how? The answer is "yes", and in the speaker's notation the result be</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="noindent"><var>y</var> log<sup><var>x</var></sup> <var>y</var> !</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="noindent">The explanation of this miracle is to be found in the intended parsing of the original formula, viz.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="noindent">(log.<var>p</var>).(log.(log.<var>p</var>))<sup><var>x</var></sup> .</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="noindent">My question on how to parse his formula was considered irrelevant since, in the mean time, it had been shown that <var>x</var>=1 could be chosen.</p>

<p>Later that day we had a Distinguished Lecturer with a survey of the complexity results for approximations. There were obvious linguistic problems. Concerning the feasibility of something, he should have written</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="noindent">"There exists a δ for which it cannot be done"</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="noindent">or perhaps</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="noindent">"For some δ, it cannot be done"</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="noindent">or perhaps</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="noindent">"It cannot be done for all δ";</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="noindent">he wrote</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="noindent">"It cannot be done, for some δ",</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="noindent">in view of the preceding formulation clearly an unfortunate choice: it should be absolutely —i.e. syntactically— clear whether the clause about {delta} is within or without the scope of the negation, and the answer now depends on the absence or presence of a comma.</p>
<p>More suspicious I became at the visual stating that something</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="noindent">"maximizes the number of random strings <var>R</var> such that [...]"</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="noindent">where this was the only occurrence of the identifier <var>R</var>. This sentence was repaired by removal of the superfluous identifier "<var>R</var>" and the here nonsensical adjective "random". (Note that also the word "random" requires some sort of scope: when you introduce "a random bit" into something, this is short for introducing 2 somethings, one with a 0 and one with a 1. The scope of the duplication has to be clear.)</p>
<p>I became totally desperate at the introduction of something of the syntactic form</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="noindent"><var>CPC</var>&nbsp;[<var>s</var>(<var>n</var>),<var>q</var>(<var>n</var>),<var>e</var>(<var>n</var>)] .</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="noindent">Here, "<var>n</var>" was of type "natural number", because that was the type of the argument of functions <var>s</var>, <var>q</var> and <var>e</var>. I <u>think</u> that <var>CPC</var> was an identifier, global to the definition being given, that <var>s</var>, <var>q</var> and <var>e</var> were formal parameters —dummies, local to the definition— of type function, and that the mentioning of <var>n</var> was just a mistake —a convoluted way of typing <var>s</var>, <var>q</var> and <var>e</var>—. I think that an "instantiation" like</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="noindent"><var>CPC</var> [<var>s</var>(7),<var>q</var>(7),<var>e</var>(7)]</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="noindent">would be completely meaningless, because the something introduced should have been of the form</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="noindent"><var>CPC</var> [<var>s</var>,<var>q</var>,<var>e</var>] .</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="noindent">I underline "<u>think</u>" because I am not sure, since I could not get the clarification I sought. When the speaker gave the expression "log(<var>n</var>)" as example of a function, I gave up.</p>
<p>I had forgotten how incredibly and unforgivably sloppy the average mathematician is, how inconsistent about his syntax and how vague about the scopes of definitions and quantifications. I love mathematics, but it's mathematicians I cannot stand, for since ALGOL 60 there is no longer an excuse. By the time I came home, I was deeply depressed.</p>
