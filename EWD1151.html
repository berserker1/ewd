<h1>A terrible Thursday</h1>
<div class='body'>				<p>Due to a conference on discrete algorithms, held here in town, the Department is flooded by speakers that &quot;are in Austin anyhow&quot;. This morning, we had a speaker on the &#x2014;I guess asymptotic&#x2014; complexity of scheduling divide-and-conquer algorithms on a hypercube machine. He tried to convey his message via a mixture of sentences, gesticulations, formulae, and pictures; the design of a &quot;language&quot; adequate for the presentation of his material seemed to me to be his most urgent task. The end of his talk was particularly unintelligible; here I confine myself to something I saw earlier.</p>				<p>I had noticed that in almost all his formulae &quot;<var>p</var>&quot; occurred in the combination &quot;log <var>p</var>&quot;, so that his formulae could be shortened by expressing them in <var>y</var> instead, with <var>y</var> and <var>p</var> linked by &quot;<var>y</var>&nbsp;=&nbsp;log <var>p</var>&quot;. But then he showed the formula &#x2014;well, not really!&#x2014;</p>				<blockquote>					<p class="noindent">log <var>p</var> log log<sup><var>x</var></sup> <var>p</var></p>				</blockquote>				<p class="noindent">Could this be expressed in <var>y </var>? And, if so, how? The answer is &quot;yes&quot;, and in the speaker's notation the result be</p>				<blockquote>					<p class="noindent"><var>y</var> log<sup><var>x</var></sup> <var>y</var> !</p>				</blockquote>				<p class="noindent">The explanation of this miracle is to be found in the intended parsing of the original formula, viz.</p>				<blockquote>					<p class="noindent">(log.<var>p</var>).(log.(log.<var>p</var>))<sup><var>x</var></sup> .</p>				</blockquote>				<p class="noindent">My question on how to parse his formula was considered irrelevant since, in the mean time, it had been shown that <var>x</var>=1 could be chosen.</p>			</div>			<div id="content" align="center">				<p class="noindent">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>					*</p>			</div>			<div id="content">				<p>Later that day we had a Distinguished Lecturer with a survey of the complexity results for approximations. There were obvious linguistic problems. Concerning the feasibility of something, he should have written</p>				<blockquote>					<p class="noindent">&quot;There exists a &#x03B4; for which it cannot be done&quot;</p>				</blockquote>				<p class="noindent">or perhaps</p>				<blockquote>					<p class="noindent">&quot;For some &#x03B4;, it cannot be done&quot;</p>				</blockquote>				<p class="noindent">or perhaps</p>				<blockquote>					<p class="noindent">&quot;It cannot be done for all &#x03B4;&quot;;</p>				</blockquote>				<p class="noindent">he wrote</p>				<blockquote>					<p class="noindent">&quot;It cannot be done, for some &#x03B4;&quot;,</p>				</blockquote>				<p class="noindent">in view of the preceding formulation clearly an unfortunate choice: it should be absolutely &#x2014;i.e. syntactically&#x2014; clear whether the clause about {delta} is within or without the scope of the negation, and the answer now depends on the absence or presence of a comma.</p>				<p>More suspicious I became at the visual stating that something</p>				<blockquote>					<p class="noindent">&quot;maximizes the number of random strings <var>R</var> such that [...]&quot;</p>				</blockquote>				<p class="noindent">where this was the only occurrence of the identifier <var>R</var>. This sentence was repaired by removal of the superfluous identifier &quot;<var>R</var>&quot; and the here nonsensical adjective &quot;random&quot;. (Note that also the word &quot;random&quot; requires some sort of scope: when you introduce &quot;a random bit&quot; into something, this is short for introducing 2 somethings, one with a 0 and one with a 1. The scope of the duplication has to be clear.)</p>				<p>I became totally desperate at the introduction of something of the syntactic form</p>				<blockquote>					<p class="noindent"><var>CPC</var>&nbsp;[<var>s</var>(<var>n</var>),<var>q</var>(<var>n</var>),<var>e</var>(<var>n</var>)] .</p>				</blockquote>				<p class="noindent">Here, &quot;<var>n</var>&quot; was of type &quot;natural number&quot;, because that was the type of the argument of functions <var>s</var>, <var>q</var> and <var>e</var>. I <u>think</u> that <var>CPC</var> was an identifier, global to the definition being given, that <var>s</var>, <var>q</var> and <var>e</var> were formal parameters &#x2014;dummies, local to the definition&#x2014; of type function, and that the mentioning of <var>n</var> was just a mistake &#x2014;a convoluted way of typing <var>s</var>, <var>q</var> and <var>e</var>&#x2014;. I think that an &quot;instantiation&quot; like</p>				<blockquote>					<p class="noindent"><var>CPC</var><i> </i>[<var>s</var>(7),<var>q</var>(7),<var>e</var>(7)]</p>				</blockquote>				<p class="noindent">would be completely meaningless, because the something introduced should have been of the form</p>				<blockquote>					<p class="noindent"><var>CPC</var><i> </i>[<var>s</var>,<var>q</var>,<var>e</var>] .</p>				</blockquote>				<p class="noindent">I underline &quot;<u>think</u>&quot; because I am not sure, since I could not get the clarification I sought. When the speaker gave the expression &quot;log(<var>n</var>)&quot; as example of a function, I gave up.</p>				<p>I had forgotten how incredibly and unforgivably sloppy the average mathematician is, how inconsistent about his syntax and how vague about the scopes of definitions and quantifications. I love mathematics, but it's mathematicians I cannot stand, for since ALGOL 60 there is no longer an excuse. By the time I came home, I was deeply depressed.</p>			</div>			<div align="center">			<p>Austin, 28 January 1993</p>		</div>			<div align="left">			<p class="noindent">prof. dr. Edsger W.
