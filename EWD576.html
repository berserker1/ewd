<p><b>On subgoal induction</b>.
<p>In [1] I encountered &ldquo;subgoal induction&rdquo; as a technique for proving partial
correctness. It was applied to a program S that I would write down as
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td colspan = 2>
    S : x:= f(x0);                                </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
        <b>do</b> B(x) &rarr; x:= g(x) <b>od</b>; </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td>
        x:= h(x) .                                </td> </tr>
</table>
In order to prove
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%>  </td><td valign=top>
{P(x0)} S {R(x0, x)}</td><td align=right>(1)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
&mdash;i.e. if P(x0) holds and the execution of S terminates properly, then in
the final state R(x0, x) will hold&mdash; &ldquo;subgoal induction&rdquo; is used. The technique
consists of finding a relation Q(x, z) satisfying
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%> </td><td valign=top>
<u>(A</u> x: (<b>non</b> B(x)) &rArr; Q(x, z))</td><td align=right>(2)
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>  </td><td valign=top>
(<u>A</u> x, z: (Q(g(x), z) <b>and</b> B(x) &rArr; Q(x, z))</td><td align=right>(3)
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>  </td><td valign=top>
(<u>A</u> x, z: (P(x) <b>and</b> Q(f(x), z)) &rArr; R(x, z))</td><td align=right>(4)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
and it was stated that the existence of a relation 0 satisfying (2), (3) and
(4) proves (1).
<p>My general inclination when I encounter such formulae &mdash;particularly when
I encounter them in a report that is really dealing with something else&mdash; is to
skim them, assuming that they are no more than variations on an old theme. 
Formula (3), however, attracted my attention, because, if P&rsquo;(x) is the invariant
relation for the repetitive construct, we have to prove &mdash;see [2]&mdash;
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%>  </td><td valign=top>
(P&rsquo;(x) <b>and</b> B(x) &rArr; P&rsquo;(g(x))</td><td align=right>(5)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
and, if we compare (5) with (3), we see that the substitution of g(x) for x
occurs at the other side of the implication! This was reason enough to 
investigate subgoal induction a little bit more closely.
<p>In terms of a relation Q satisfying (2), (3), and (4), we can take as
our invariant relation
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%>  </td><td valign=top>
P&rsquo;(x): (<u>A</u> z: Q(x, z) &rArr; Q(f(x0), z))</td><td align=right>(6)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
a relation which is clearly established by &ldquo;x:= f(x0)&rdquo; , the first statement of
S . To prove (S) we have to prove
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%>  </td><td valign=top>
((<u>A</u> z: Q(x, z) &rArr; Q(f(x0), z)) <b>and</b> B(x)) &rArr;
((<u>A</u> z: Q(g(x), z) &rArr; Q(f(x0), z))</td><td align=right>(7)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
For those values of x , such that B(x) is false, the implication (7) is 
vacuously true, for those values of x , such that B(x) is true, (3) tells us that
Q(g(x), z) is a stronger condition on 2 than Q(x, z) , so that whatever is
implied by the latter is certainly implied by the former. Hence (7) and thus (5)
follows from (3).
<p>Finally we have to prove that
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%>  </td><td valign=top>
(P&rsquo;(x) <b>and</b> <b>non</b> B(x)) &rArr; wp(&ldquo;x:= h(x)&rdquo;. R(x0, x))</td><td align=right>(8)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
Thanks to (2) and (6), the left-hand side of (8) reduces to
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
      (<u>A</u> z: Q(x, z) &rArr; Q(f(x0), z)) <b>and</b> Q(x, h(x)) </td> </tr>
</table>
from which we conclude &mdash;applying the quantified implication for z = h(x)&mdash;
the truth of
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
      Q(f(x0), h(x)) . </td> </tr>
</table>
Because the initial value x0 satisfies P(x0) , we conclude &mdash;applying (4)
with x = x0 and z = h(x)&mdash; the truth of
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
      R(x0, h(x)) </td> </tr>
</table>
but thanks to the axiom of assignment this is identical to the right-hand side
of (8). Hence (8) frollows from (2), (4), and (6).
<p>Thus we have established that &mdash;as was to be expected&mdash; subgoal induction
is indeed the next variation on an old theme.
<p>The analysis described above was carried through together with C.S. Scholten.
