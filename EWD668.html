<b>On the correctness of a design by Alain J.Martin.</b>
<p>Alain J.Martin invented the following problem and its solution. (He
had more solutions, but here we confine our attention to one of them.)
<p><b>The problem.</b> We consider a finite number of customer mosquitoes M ,
each with its dedicated service mosquito m . Each customer mosquito is
synchronized with its service mosquito m via three different communication
commands, denoted by m.p!, m.c? , and m.v! . (As the messages are
empty, the separation in input commands and output commands is somewhat
artificial.) The text of each customer mosquito is:
<table> <tr> <td>M:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td colspan = 3>
    <b>begin</b> <b>do</b> true &rarr; a noncritical section; </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
                     m.p!; m.c?;                              </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td>
                     critical section;                        </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td>
                     m.v!                                     </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td colspan = 2>
            <b>od</b>                                         </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td colspan = 3>
    <b>end</b>                                                </td> </tr>
</table>
(Here &ldquo;m.p!&rdquo; can be viewed as the initiation of P(mutex) , &ldquo;m.c?&rdquo; as the
completion of P(mutex) , and &ldquo;m.v!&rdquo; as V(mutex).)
<p>The problem is to design the service mosquitoes m and their 
interconnection in such a way that at any moment in time <b>at most one</b> customer
mosquito M is engaged in its critical section.
<p><b>The solution</b>. The service mosquitoes m are placed in a ring; each
service mosquito refers to its anti-clockwise neighbour as &ldquo;L&rdquo;, to its 
clockwise neighbour as &ldquo;R&rdquo;. Each service mosquito m has a local boolean &ldquo;pri&rdquo;
(short for &ldquo;privilege&rdquo;) initialized at <b>false</b>, except for <b>one</b> exceptional
service mosquito.
<table> <tr> <td>m: &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td colspan = 3>
   <b>begin</b> <b>var</b> pri: boolean; pri:= (m is the exceptional one);                                         </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td colspan = 2>
         <b>do</b> M.p? &rarr; <b>do</b> <b>non</b> pri &rarr; R.p!; R.c?; pri:= true <b>od</b>; M.c!; M.v?               </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td>&nbsp; </td> <td>
          &#x25af; L.p? &rarr; <b>do</b> <b>non</b> pri &rarr; R.p!; R.c?; pri:= true <b>od;</b> pri:= false; L.c! </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td colspan = 2>
         <b>od</b>                                                                                                 </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td colspan = 3>
   <b>end</b>                                                                                                      </td> </tr>
</table>
(The reader needn&rsquo;t be bothered by the redundant coding; we hope that the
                            
redundancy will ease the discussion.)
<p align="center" class="noindent">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>*</p>  
<p>The above design is worthy of our attention because in its structure
it differs very much from the (ring-shaped!) designs we have considered 
before. I shall try to convince (myself and) my readers of its correctness
by what seems the most effective &mdash;be it perhaps ad hoc&mdash; argument. (Whether
this argument, or parts of it, fit in a more general pattern that we can
make respectable, is an important, but later concern.)
<p align="center" class="noindent">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>*</p>  
<p>The mutual exclusion of the critical sections is easily proved.
Because in M 
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
</td><td>m.c?; critical section; m.v!
</td>  </tr>  </table>
coincides by definition with
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
</td><td>M.c!; M.v?
</td>  </tr>  </table>
in its service mosquito, it suffices to prove the mutual exclusion of the
latter. Because during the latter the pri of the corresponding m is
true, mutual exclusion is guaranteed if we can show that at most one 
pri-value is true.
<p>By placing funny brackets &lt; R.c?; pri:= true &gt; (twice) and
&lt; pri:= false; L.c! &gt;&rsquo; (once) , we see, because each R.c? coincides
by definition with an L.c! , that at any moment &mdash;with this invention
of atomic actions!&mdash; there is exactly one pri-value true. The mutual
exclusion is therefore guaranteed. (The above invention of the atomic
actions seems a suitable candidate for being made more respectable!)
<p align="center" class="noindent">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>*</p>  
<p>The above trick of combining communication commands into atomic
actions &mdash;what about calling them &ldquo;point actions&rdquo; like the &ldquo;point masses&rdquo;
in mechanics?&mdash; nicely reflects that they embody mutual coincidence, and
I shall try to apply it again. Let each customer mosquito M have an
auxiliary boolean b0 , initialized at true , and let each service
mosquito m have two auxiliary booleans, both initialized at false.
For the customer mosquito I propose the following text:
                    
<table> <tr> <td>M:&nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td colspan = 3>
   <b>begin</b> <b>var</b> b0: boolean; b0:= true;                        </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td colspan = 2>
       <b>do</b> true &rarr; noncritical section;                         </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
                 &lt; m.p!; b0:= false &gt; ; &lt; m.c?; b0:= true &gt; ; </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td>
                 critical section;                                        </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td>
                 m.v!                                                     </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td colspan = 2>
       <b>od</b>                                                          </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td colspan = 3>
   <b>end</b>                                                             </td> </tr>
</table>

For the service mosquitoes we depart more from the original text and also
express syntactically that the inner repetitive constructs will be executed
at most once:
<table> <tr> <td>m:&nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td colspan = 6>
   <b>begin</b> <b>var</b> bl, b2, pri: boolean;                                </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td colspan = 5>
       bl, b2, pri := false, false, (m is the exceptional one);                 </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td colspan = 5>
       <b>do</b> &lt; M.p? &rarr; bl:= true &gt; ;                              </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td colspan = 3>
                   <b>if</b> pri &rarr; &lt; bl, b2 := false, true &gt;         </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td>&nbsp; </td> <td colspan = 2>
                    &#x25af; <b>non</b> pri &rarr;·&lt; R.p!; b1:= false &gt; ; </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
                               &lt; R.c?; b2:= true; pri:= true &gt;            </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td colspan = 3>
                   <b>fi;</b>                                                   </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td colspan = 3>
                   &lt; M.c!; b2:= false &gt; ; M.v?                            </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td colspan = 4>
          &#x25af; &lt; L.p? &rarr; b1:= true &gt; ;                            </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td colspan = 3>
                   <b>if</b> pri &rarr; &lt; bl, b2 := false, true &gt;         </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td colspan = 2>
                    &#x25af; <b>non</b> pri &rarr; &lt; R.p!; b1:= false &gt; ; </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td>
                               &lt; R.c?; b2:= true; pri:= true &gt;            </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td colspan = 3>
                   <b>fi</b> ;                                                  </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td colspan = 3>
                   &lt; pri:= false; L.c!; b2:= false &gt;                      </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td colspan = 5>
       <b>od</b>                                                                </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td colspan = 6>
   <b>end</b>                                                                   </td> </tr>
</table>

<p>Because each query command &mdash;with the exception of M.v? &mdash; sets a
false boolean b0 , b1, or b2 to true, and each exclamation command &mdash;with
the exception of m.v!&mdash; sets a true boolean false, the number of true
b&rsquo;s (b0, b1, or b2) remains constantly equal to its initial value, i.e.
the number of (M,m)-pairs in the ring. For each service mosquito we further
observe the invariant truths of
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
</td><td><b>non</b> (b1 <b>and</b> b2) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  pri <b>or</b> <b>non</b> b2 .
</td>  </tr>  </table>
                       
<p>When all customer mosquitoes are in their noncritical section,
all b0&rsquo;s are true, hence all b1&rsquo;s and b2&rsquo;s are false, hence all
service mosquitoes are ready to honour the query guards &ldquo;M.p?&rdquo; and
&ldquo;L.p?&rdquo; . The latter, however, cannot compete with the &ldquo;M.p?&rdquo; , because
no m-mosquito is ready for the execution of &ldquo;R.p!&rdquo; . Hence, if a
number of M-mosquitoes has completed its noncritical section and is
ready to execute &ldquo;m.p!&rdquo; , at least one will be able to do so and to
set its b0 false.
<p>Next we shall show how, when one or more b0&rsquo;s are false, a 
customer mosquito will be admitted to its critical section in a finite 
period of time; because each critical section is finite, it suffices to
consider the situation in which none of the customer mosquitoes is 
engaged in its critical section.
<p>For each b0 turned false, a b1 has been turned true in the
first outer alternative &mdash;i.e. at the execution of &lt; M.p? &rarr; b1:= true &gt;&mdash;
of the corresponding m-mosquito. If this happened in the service mosquito
with pri true , the true b1 wil be exchanged for a true b2 &mdash;by
&ldquo;b1, b2 2: false, true&rdquo;&mdash; , the corresponding customer will then be
admitted to its critical section. Otherwise a true b1 can only travel
clockwise &mdash;via &lt; R.p!; b1:= false &gt; and &lt; L.p? - b1:= true &gt;&mdash; ; the
one with the minimum clockwise distance from it to the mosquito with
pri true will do so until it has reached that service mosquito, where
it will be exchanged for a true b2 &mdash;by &lt; b1, b2 := false, true &gt;&rsquo;in
the second outer alternative&mdash; . A true b2 can only travel 
anti-clockwise &mdash;via &lt; pri:= false; L.c!; b2:= false &gt;- and &lt; R.c?; b2:= true;
pri:= true &gt; &mdash; ; on its anti-clockwise trip it takes the true pri as
a companion with it, until it returns to the nearest mosquito waiting for
it in the first outer alternative, where it will be exchanged &mdash;via
&lt; M.c!; b2:= false &gt;-and &lt; m.c?; b0:= true &gt; &mdash; for a true b0 , and
the customer mosquito is allowed to enter its critical section.
<p>I don&rsquo;t regard the rather operational argument of the above paragraph
as fully satisfactory. We could have made it more explicit by making &ldquo;R.p1&rdquo;
and &ldquo;L.p?&rdquo; transmit as message the number of the m-mosquito that  
                  
introduced &mdash;via &lt; M.p? &rarr; b1:= true &gt;&mdash; the true b1 into the m-ring .
(I shall not do so, the reader can do so for himself, if he so desires.)
The argument that true b1&rsquo;s can only travel clockwise, but cannot do
so indefinitely, because one will hit the mosquito with pri true, in
which it will be reflected as a true b2 , which can only travel 
anti-clockwise, but cannot do so indefinitely because it will be absorbed
by the m-mosquito that introduced into the m-ring the true b1 from
which it ultimately originated, is only ok in the absence of deadlock:
we have argued that we have described the only possible history, but will
it happen? The next section of this note will therefore be devoted to
deadlock analysis. 
<p align="center" class="noindent">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>*</p> 
<p>From the text of the M-mosquitoes we derive syntacticly that its
communication pattern is given by
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%>  </td><td valign=top>
{m.p! , m.c?, m.v!} .</td><td align=right>(1)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
From the text of the m-mosquitoes we derive similarly the syntax for
the communication pattern
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%>  </td><td valign=top>
{M.p?, ( | R.p!, R.c?), M.c!, M.v? L.p? , ( | R.p!;, R.c?), L.c!}</td><td align=right>(2)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
when we &ldquo;project&rdquo; this grammar on M &mdash;i.e. omit all communications not
communicating with M &mdash; we get
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%>  </td><td valign=top>
{M.p?, M.c!, M.v?}</td><td align=right>(3)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
and observe that (1) and (3) match beautifully. Projecting (2) on R we get
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%>  </td><td valign=top>
{( | R.p.!, R.c?) | ( | R.p|, R.c?)}</td><td align=right>
</td>  </tr>  </table>
which reduces to
<table width=100%>
<tr<sub>></sub><td valign=top width=10%>  </td><td valign=top>
{R.p!, R.c?} ;</td><td align=right>(4)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
projecting (2) on L , we get by a similar reduction
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%>  </td><td valign=top>
{L.p?, L.c!}</td><td align=right>(5)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
and observe that also (4) and (5) match beautifully with each other.
<p>Due to the absence of alternatives as would be indicated by &ldquo;|&rdquo; and
of nested brace pairs, the matching syntaxes can generate each only one
infinite sentence. As a result the possibility of a &ldquo;local conflict&rdquo; is

excluded, where with a local conflict we mean the situation in which the
partners at the two ends of a channel are ready to communicate with each
other, but with nonmatching commands, i.e. commands with different labels
or without query/exclamation matching. In passing we conclude that in
this example the labelling with &ldquo;p&rdquo;, &ldquo;c&rdquo;, and &ldquo;v&rdquo; is superfluous.
<p>An earlier version of this text proceeded at this point with the
proof of the absence of the danger of deadlock, because without further
assumptions the absence of the danger of individual starvation cannot be
proved. In retrospect it is more efficient to make the further assumption
and to proceed directly to a proof of the &mdash;in general stronger&mdash; statement
that the danger of individual starvation is absent. The further assumption
is that the nondeterminecy in the repetitive construct of each service
mosquito is resolved by a fair daemon, more precisely
<br>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that a customer mosquito permanently blocked at its &ldquo;m.p!&rdquo; implies
that the nondeterminacy of its service mosquito has only been resolved
a finite number of times; with the assumption of finite speeds this implies
that its service mosquito is eventually permanently blocked at one of its
communication commands inside the first or the second outer alternative
<br>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that a service mosquito permanently blocked at its &ldquo;R.p!&rdquo; implies
that the nondeterminacy of its clockwise neighbour has only been resolved
a finite number of times; with the assumption of finite speeds this implies
that its clockwise neighbour is eventually permanently blocked at one of
its communication commands inside the first or the second outer alternative.
<p>On account of the matching between (1) and (3), the grammar (2)
tells us that no service mosquito can be permanently blocked on its &ldquo;M.c!&rdquo;
or its &ldquo;M.v?&rdquo; . (This conclusion remains valid if the requirement of
finite speed is relaxed for a customer mosquito engaged in its noncritical
section.)
<p>Furthermore syntax (2) tells us that each &ldquo;R.c?&rdquo; has been preceded
by its &ldquo;R.p!&rdquo;, which, if &ldquo;R.c?&rdquo; causes blocking, has been honoured by
the &ldquo;L.p?&rdquo; of its clockwise neighbour. Again syntax (2) tells us that
this blocking &mdash;i.e. the inability of the clockwise neighbour to perform
the matching &ldquo;L.c!&rdquo;&mdash; implies that the clockwise neighbour is blocked at
&ldquo;R.p!&rdquo; or &ldquo;R.c?&rdquo; .
                       
<p>Finally syntax (2) tells us that no service mosquito can ever be
blocked permanently on its &ldquo;L.c!&rdquo; , as it has been preceded by its &ldquo;L.p?&rdquo;
which has been honoured by the &ldquo;R.p!&rdquo; of its anti-clockwise neighbour, which
by doing so becomes ready to honour via &ldquo;R.c?&rdquo; the &ldquo;L.c!&rdquo; in question.
<p>As a result, a customer mosquito permanently blocked at &ldquo;m.p!&rdquo;&rsquo;
implies its service mosquito permanently blocked at either &ldquo;R.p!&rdquo; or
&ldquo;R.c?&rdquo;; and a service mosquito permanently blocked at either &ldquo;R.p!&rdquo; or
&ldquo;R.c?&rdquo; implies that its clockwise neighbour is permanently blocked at
either &ldquo;R.p!&rdquo; or &ldquo;R.c?&rdquo;. Via induction we conclude that a customer
mosquito permanently blocked at &ldquo;m.p!&rdquo; implies that all service mosquitoes
are blocked at either &ldquo;R.p!&rdquo; or &ldquo;R.c?&rdquo;. As this implies that all 
pri-values are false, we conclude that no customer mosquito will be permanently
blocked at &ldquo;m.p!&rdquo;.
<p>A customer mosquito permanently blocked at &ldquo;m.c?&rdquo; &mdash;to be matched
by &ldquo;M.c!&rdquo; of its service mosquito&mdash; would also imply that this service
mosquito is permanently blocked by either &ldquo;R.p!&rdquo; or &ldquo;R.c?&rdquo;; the same 
argument allows us to conclude that no customer mosquito will be permanently
blocked by its &ldquo;m.c?&rdquo;.
<p>That no customer mosquito will be permanently blocked at &ldquo;m.v!&rdquo;
is obvious from grammars (1) and (2).
<p>With the above the absence of the danger of deadlock has been 
demonstrated. We note &mdash;for later?&mdash; that in this last argument the auxiliary
variables b0 , b1 , and b2 have played no role whatsoever: the grammars
(1) through (5) &mdash;of which only (1) and (2) are independent&mdash; gave all the
information, together with the knowledge of one true pri-value in the ring.
