  <h1>The checkers problem told to me by M.O.Rabin</h1>
  <div class='body'>
				<p>Last week, during the annual seminar at the University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Michael O. Rabin told me the following problem.</p>
				<p>Consider an infinite checkers board, of which the columns and rows are identified by the integer coordinates &nbsp;<var>x</var>&nbsp; and &nbsp;<var>y</var>&nbsp; respectively. Initially, there is a piece on each square whose coordinates satisfy &nbsp; <span class="inlineformula">(<var>even</var>.<var>x</var> &#x2261; <var>even</var>.<var>y</var>) <span class="unicode">&#x2227;</span> <var>y</var> <span class="unicode">&#x2264;</span> 0.</span> &nbsp; Pieces can be moved "upwards" by the usual "capturing moves": from <img src="EWD1134_fig1.png" alt="EWD1134 figure 1" title="EWD1134 figure 1" /> to <img src="EWD1134_fig2.png" alt="EWD1134 figure 2" title="EWD1134 figure 2" /> and from <img src="EWD1134_fig3.png" alt="EWD1134 figure 3" title="EWD1134 figure 3" /> to <img src="EWD1134_fig4.png" alt="EWD1134 figure 4" title="EWD1134 figure 4" />. The question posed is whether there is an upper bound on the y-coordinates of the squares that may be occupied.</p>

				<p align="center"><sup>*</sup> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <sub>*</sub> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <sup>*</sup></p>
				<p>Because the question asked is about <var>y</var>-coordinates, we abstract for a moment from the <var>x</var>-coordinate. The two original moves then become one and the same move: from <img src="EWD1134_fig5.png" alt="EWD1134 figure 5" title="EWD1134 figure 5" /> to <img src="EWD1134_fig6.png" alt="EWD1134 figure 6" title="EWD1134 figure 6" />. In order to capture that a high piece is created from ("is as good as", "corresponds to") its two successors &mdash;those who know him see Fibonacci lurking around the corner!&mdash; , we give a piece (on a square) at height &nbsp;<var>y</var>&nbsp; a <span style="border-bottom: thin dashed #000000;">weight</span> &nbsp;<var>&#x03c6;</var><sup><var>y</var></sup>&nbsp; with &nbsp;<var>&#x03c6;</var>&nbsp; the positive root of &nbsp; <span class="inlineformula"><var>&#x03c6;</var><sup>2</sup> = <var>&#x03c6;</var> + 1 .</span> The equation is chosen so that the weight of the new piece equals the weight of the two pieces it replaces, i.e. a move is neutral as far as total weight is concerned. By restricting ourselves to the positive root, we keep all weights positive, i.e. total weight a monotonic function of the number of pieces involved. Solving the equation yields</p>
				<table class="numfor"><tr><td class="numforleft"><br />
		      <var>&#x03c6;</var> = (1 + &#x221A;5)/2 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .<br /></td></tr></table>
				<p>The fact that a move is neutral as far as total weight is concerned, means that the creation of a piece at height &nbsp;<var>Y</var>&nbsp; (with <var>Y</var>&gt;0) uses from the original configuration a set of pieces with total weight <var>&#x03c6;</var><sup><var>Y</var></sup>. This "target weight", being <var>&#x03c6;</var><sup><var>Y</var></sup> and <var>&#x03c6;</var> being positive, grows <span style="border-bottom: thin dashed #000000;">exponentially</span> with <var>Y</var>. We shall next observe that, in view of the shape of the two moves &mdash;<var>x</var> re-enters the picture&mdash; , the original pieces involved in the creation of a piece at height &nbsp;<var>Y</var>&nbsp; come from a restricted area. Calling their total weight the "available weight", we shall show that the latter grows <span style="border-bottom: thin dashed #000000;">linearly</span> with <var>Y</var>. Hence, the condition</p>
				<p align="center">target weight &#x2264;  available weight</p>
				<p class="noindent">imposes an upper bound on <var>Y</var>: the answer to the question posed is "Yes".</p>
				<p>In order to establish the available weight we observe the moves for small values of <var>Y</var>.</p>
				<p class="noindent"><var>Y</var>=1 requires a single move, say <img src="EWD1134_fig7.png" alt="EWD1134 figure 7" title="EWD1134 figure 7" style="	position: relative; bottom: -32px;" />&nbsp; &nbsp;.</p>
				<p class="noindent" style="position: relative; top: -30px;"><var>Y</var>=2 requires two moves, say <img src="EWD1134_fig8.png" alt="EWD1134 figure 8" title="EWD1134 figure 8" style="	position: relative; bottom: -72px;" />&nbsp; &nbsp;,<br />the one thin dot above the<br />line indicating a square<br />that has been temporarily<br />occupied.</p>
				<p class="noindent" style="position: relative; top: -70px;"><var>Y</var>=3 requires two moves more. <img src="EWD1134_fig9.png" alt="EWD1134 figure 9" title="EWD1134 figure 9" style="	position: relative; bottom: -70px;" />&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
				<p>For the restricted areas from which the original pieces have to be recruited we take infinite (truncated) triangles</p>
				<table cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td><img src="EWD1134_fig10.png" alt="EWD1134 figure 10" title="EWD1134 figure 10" /></td><td><img src="EWD1134_fig11.png" alt="EWD1134 figure 11" title="EWD1134 figure 11" /></td><td><img src="EWD1134_fig12.png" alt="EWD1134 figure 12" title="EWD1134 figure 12" /></td></tr></table>
				<p>For <var>Y</var>=1&nbsp;, the available weight <span class="inlineformula">(&#x2211;<var>n</var>: <var>n</var>&#x2265;0: (<var>n</var>+1)<span class="unicode">&#x2217;</span><var>&#x03C6;</var><sup>-<var>n</var></sup>)</span> is finite, and so is the increment <span class="inlineformula">(&#x2211;<var>n</var>: a&#x2265;0: <var>&#x03C6;</var><sup>-<var>n</var></sup>)</span>. Summing the sequences one finds for the available weight</p>
				<p align="center" class="noindent"><u>&nbsp;4 + 2&#x221A;5 + <var>Y</var><span class="unicode">&#x2217;</span>(3 + &#x221A;5)&nbsp;</u><br />2</p>
				<p>The smallest value for &nbsp;<var>Y</var>&nbsp; such that the target weight <var>&#x03C6;</var><sup><var>Y</var></sup> exceeds the available weight is &nbsp;7&nbsp;: then the target weight equals <span class="inlineformula">(29+13&#x221A;5)/2,</span> the available weight is only <span class="inlineformula">(25+9&#x221A;5)/2</span> .</p>
				<p>For <var>Y</var>=6, the target weight <span class="inlineformula"> (18+8&#x221A;5)/2 </span> is less than the available weight <span class="inlineformula"> (22+8&#x221A;5)/2 ,</span> but this does not justify the conclusion that Y=6 is attainable. <var>Y</var>=6 can be achieved, but the only way of showing this that I know of is showing a game that does the job. The required game turns out to have 53 moves, which makes finding it and reporting it somewhat of a challenge. I could convince myself that <var>Y</var>=6 could be reached only</p>
				<p class="noindent">(i) after having realized that the constraint of at most 1 piece per square is inessential and can be stopped</p>
				<p class="noindent">(ii) after having decided to play the game backwards</p>
				<p>Below, we show successive stages of the backwards game: in the centre the configuration of the pieces, to the left the <var>y</var>-coordinates of the rows in question and &mdash;by way of check&mdash; to the right for each row the total number of pieces in it.</p>

				<p>There may exist a game of 51 moves, but I am not interested in that optimization. The above is already more elaborate than I had hoped.</p>
