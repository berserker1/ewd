<p class="noindent"><b>On two types of infinite sets of infinite sequences</b>.</p>
<center>by the Tuesday Afternoon Club.</center>
<p>In the following x will stand for the infinite sequence (x(0), x(1), x(2), ...........) where the x(i) are taken from a finite alphabet of at least two characters, say {0, 1}</p>
<p>Let us consider the sets of sequences S1 and S2 , defined as the solution sets of the equations P1(x) and P2(x), respectively, with</p>
<table width="100%">
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="10%">Pl(x):</td>
<td>(<u>E</u> i: i ≥ 0: (<u>A</u> j: 0 ≤ j &lt; i: x(j) = 0) <b>and</b> (<u>A</u> j: i ≤ j: x(j) = 1))</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">P2(x):</td>
<td>(<u>A</u> i: i ≥ 0: x(i) = 0 <b>or</b> (<u>A</u> j: j ≥ i: x(j) = 1)) .</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Because P1(x) ⇒ P2(x) , S1 is a subset of S2 , even a proper subset: there exists one solution of P2(x) <b>and</b> <b>non</b> P1(x) , viz. the sequence with x(1) = 0 for all i ≥ 0.</p>
<p>The set S2 has the property that for any non-member of S2 —i.e. any solution of <b>non</b> P2(x)— non-membership can be established on account of an initial segment of it. As a matter of fact, in this particular case only two elements suffice for this evidence, as follows from <b>non</b> P2(x):</p>
<table width="100%">
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="10%"></td>
<td>(<u>E</u> i: i &gt; 0: x(i) ≠ 0 <b>and</b> (<u>E</u> j: j &gt; i: x(j) ≠ 1)) .</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>The set S1 doesn’t have this property because there exists a non-member —viz. x(i) = 0 for all i ≥ 0— with the property that any initial segment of it is also the initial segment of a member of S1 . We call S2 “closed” and S1 “non-closed”, that is:</p>
<table width="100%">
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="10%"></td>
<td>“The set S is closed” means “any non-member of S has an initial segment that is not the initial segment of any member of S”.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"></td>
<td>“The set S is non-closed” means “there exists a non-member of S such that any initial segment of it is also the initial segment of some member of S ”.</td>
</tr>
</table>
From the above it follows<br>
1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that a set of sequences is either closed or non-closed,<br>
2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that any finite set —in particular the empty set— is closed,<br>
3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that the (uncountably infinite) universe of all possible sequences is closed.
<p align="center" class="noindent">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>
*</p>
<p>The notion of a closed set is of significance in connection with non-deterministic infinite computations. Consider the set of possible output sequences y corresponding to</p>
<table width="100%">
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="10%"></td>
<td valign="top">“initialize; i:= 0;</td>
<td align="right">(1)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"></td>
<td valign="top"><b>do</b> true → compute; print(y(i)); i:= i + 1 <b>od</b>”</td>
<td align="right"></td>
</tr>
</table>
Here “initialize” and “compute” stand for terminating computations not affecting the value of i . If “initialize” and “compute” stand for deterministic computations, the set of possible output sequences consists of a single element; if “initialize” and (in particular) “compute” are non-deterministic, the corresponding set of possible output sequences can be infinite.
<table width="100%">
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="10%"></td>
<td>“Program (1) is a continuous machine” means “in program (1) ”initialize“ and ”compute“ are both of bounded non-determinacy”.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p class="noindent">We can now prove the following</p>
<p class="noindent"><b>Theorem 1</b>. The possible output sequences of program (1) form a closed set or program (1) is not a continuous machine.</p>
<p class="noindent"><b>Proof</b>. Let S be the set of possible output sequences of program (1). Either S is closed —in which case Theorem 1 holds— or S is non-closed. In the latter case, let x be a non-member of S such that each initial segment of x is also an initial segment of some member of S . Consider now the following program:</p>
<table width="100%">
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="10%"></td>
<td>“initialize; i=: 0;</td>
<td align="right">(2)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"></td>
<td><b>do</b> ”y(0),...,y(i-1) is an initial segment of x “ →</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"></td>
<td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; compute; print(y(i)); i:= i + 1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"></td>
<td><b>od</b>; print(i)”</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Non-termination of (2) is excluded because x is not a member of S Because <b>each</b> initial segment of x is also the initial segment of some member of S , the final value of i is unbounded. Hence, program (2) is a (weakly) terminating program of unbounded non-determinacy; hence “initialize” or “compute” is of unbounded non-determinacy, i.e. program (1) is not a continuous machine. (End of Proof.)</p>
<p class="noindent"><b>Theorem 2</b>. A set of sequences is non-closed <b>or</b> is the set of possible output sequences of some continuous machine.</p>
<p class="noindent">Proof. Let S be the set of sequences. Either set S is non-closed —in which case Theorem 2 holds— or it is closed. In the latter case consider program (1) with “initialize” deterministic and “compute” only constrained by the requirement that the next y(i) leads to an initial segment of some element of S . Because the alphabet is finite, “compute” need not be of unbounded non-determinacy. By virtue of its construction program (1) may then generate <b>any</b> member of S , and, S being closed, it cannot generate any non-member of S . (End of Proof.)</p>
<p>Having identified closed sets of possible output sequences with continuous machines, we propose to ignore for the time being non-deterministic infinite computations to which non-closed sets correspond.</p>
