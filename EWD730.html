<b>On two types of infinite sets of infinite sequences</b>.
<center>by the Tuesday Afternoon Club.</center>
<p>In the following x will stand for the infinite sequence
(x(0), x(1), x(2), ...........)
where the x(i) are taken from a finite alphabet of at least two characters,
say {0, 1}
<p>Let us consider the sets of sequences S1 and S2 , defined as the
solution sets of the equations P1(x) and P2(x), respectively, with
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
Pl(x):</td><td>(<u>E</u> i: i &ge; 0: (<u>A</u> j: 0 &le; j &lt; i: x(j) = 0) <b>and</b> (<u>A</u> j: i &le; j: x(j) = 1))
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>
P2(x):</td><td>(<u>A</u> i: i &ge; 0: x(i) = 0 <b>or</b> (<u>A</u> j: j &ge; i: x(j) = 1))      .
</td>  </tr>  </table>
<p>Because P1(x) &rArr; P2(x) , S1 is a subset of S2 , even a proper subset:
there exists one solution of P2(x) <b>and</b> <b>non</b> P1(x) , viz. the sequence with
x(1) = 0 for all i &ge; 0.
<p>The set S2 has the property that for any non-member of S2 &mdash;i.e.
any solution of <b>non</b> P2(x)&mdash; non-membership can be established on account
of an initial segment of it. As a matter of fact, in this particular case
only two elements suffice for this evidence, as follows from <b>non</b> P2(x):
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
</td><td>(<u>E</u> i: i &gt; 0: x(i) &ne; 0 <b>and</b> (<u>E</u> j: j &gt; i: x(j) &ne; 1)) .
</td>  </tr>  </table>
<p>The set S1 doesn&rsquo;t have this property because there exists a 
non-member &mdash;viz. x(i) = 0 for all i &ge; 0&mdash; with the property that any initial
segment of it is also the initial segment of a member of S1 . We call S2
&ldquo;closed&rdquo; and S1 &ldquo;non-closed&rdquo;, that is:
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
</td><td>&ldquo;The set S is closed&rdquo; means &ldquo;any non-member of S has an initial 
segment that is not the initial segment of any member of S&rdquo;.
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>
</td><td>&ldquo;The set S is non-closed&rdquo; means &ldquo;there exists a non-member of S
such that any initial segment of it is also the initial segment of
some member of S &rdquo;.
</td>  </tr>  </table>
                    
From the above it follows
<br>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that a set of sequences is either closed or non-closed,
<br>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that any finite set &mdash;in particular the empty set&mdash; is closed,
<br>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that the (uncountably infinite) universe of all possible sequences is
closed.
 <p align="center" class="noindent">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>*</p> 
<p>The notion of a closed set is of significance in connection with 
non-deterministic infinite computations. Consider the set of possible output
sequences y corresponding to
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%>  </td><td valign=top>
&ldquo;initialize; i:= 0;</td><td align=right>(1)
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>  </td><td valign=top>
<b>do</b> true &rarr; compute; print(y(i)); i:= i + 1 <b>od</b>&rdquo;</td><td align=right>
</td>  </tr>  </table>
Here &ldquo;initialize&rdquo; and &ldquo;compute&rdquo; stand for terminating computations not 
affecting the value of i . If &ldquo;initialize&rdquo; and &ldquo;compute&rdquo; stand for 
deterministic computations, the set of possible output sequences consists of a single
element; if &ldquo;initialize&rdquo; and (in particular) &ldquo;compute&rdquo; are non-deterministic,
the corresponding set of possible output sequences can be infinite.
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
</td><td>&ldquo;Program (1) is a continuous machine&rdquo; means &ldquo;in program (1) &rdquo;initialize&ldquo;
and &rdquo;compute&ldquo; are both of bounded non-determinacy&rdquo;.
</td>  </tr>  </table>
<p class=noindent>We can now prove the following
<p class=noindent><b>Theorem 1</b>. The possible output sequences of program (1) form a closed set
or program (1) is not a continuous machine.
<p class=noindent><b>Proof</b>. Let S be the set of possible output sequences of program (1).
Either S is closed &mdash;in which case Theorem 1 holds&mdash; or S is non-closed.
In the latter case, let x be a non-member of S such that each initial
segment of x is also an initial segment of some member of S . Consider
now the following program:
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
</td><td>&ldquo;initialize; i=: 0;</td><td align=right> (2)
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>
</td><td><b>do</b> &rdquo;y(0),...,y(i-1) is an initial segment of x &ldquo; &rarr;
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>
</td><td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; compute; print(y(i)); i:= i + 1
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>
</td><td><b>od</b>; print(i)&rdquo;
</td>  </tr>  </table>
                                   
<p>Non-termination of (2) is excluded because x is not a member of S
Because <b>each</b> initial segment of x is also the initial segment of some
member of S , the final value of i is unbounded. Hence, program (2)
is a (weakly) terminating program of unbounded non-determinacy; hence
&ldquo;initialize&rdquo; or &ldquo;compute&rdquo; is of unbounded non-determinacy, i.e. program (1)
is not a continuous machine. (End of Proof.)
<p class=noindent><b>Theorem 2</b>. A set of sequences is non-closed <b>or</b> is the set of possible output
sequences of some continuous machine.
<p class=noindent>Proof. Let S be the set of sequences. Either set S is non-closed &mdash;in
which case Theorem 2 holds&mdash; or it is closed. In the latter case consider
program (1) with &ldquo;initialize&rdquo; deterministic and &ldquo;compute&rdquo; only constrained
by the requirement that the next y(i) leads to an initial segment of some
element of S . Because the alphabet is finite, &ldquo;compute&rdquo; need not be of
unbounded non-determinacy. By virtue of its construction program (1) may
then generate <b>any</b> member of S , and, S being closed, it cannot generate
any non-member of S . (End of Proof.)
<p>Having identified closed sets of possible output sequences with 
continuous machines, we propose to ignore for the time being non-deterministic
infinite computations to which non-closed sets correspond.
