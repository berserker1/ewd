        <p><u>A bagatelle for
        the left hand</u></p>
        <p>This is a kind of glossary --very incomplete, I am afraid-- of terminology I have learned to suspect. There was a time when it used to disturb me to hear or see the heavy use of a term that was never or rarily employed by myself. But, as the years went by, I discovered that I remained quite happy without those terms in my active vocabulary, and my sense of guilt has disappeared to the extent that their use by others can now make me quite suspicious. (The idea to write such a glossary dates from well before I broke my right arm; hence its low serial number.)</p>
        <p><u>real</u><br>
							<br>
							
        Beware of &quot;the real world&quot;. A speaker's appeal to it is always
        an invitation not to challenge his tacit assumptions. When a speaker
        refers to the real world, a useful counterploy is pointing out that he
        only refers to <u>his</u> perception of it. We find it nowadays
        hyphenated in &quot;real-world problems&quot;; please remember that
        those are typically the ones we are left with when we have refused to
        apply their effective solutions.<br>
							<br>
							
        References to &quot;real programmers&quot; I usually counter by the
        rhetorical question &quot;Am I a virtual programmer?&quot;<br>
							<br>
							
        Make it a habit to check whether &quot;real&quot; is used as a euphemism
        for &quot;education resistant&quot;. The &quot;real&quot; in &quot;real
        numbers&quot; passes this test and is quite respectable (provided you
        believe in Cantor and Dedekind).</p>

        <p><u>natural</u> versus
<u>artificial</u><br>
							<br>
							
        It is not only the food industry that employs &quot;natural&quot; as a
        vague recommendation. (The almonds the airlines serve with the drinks
        are always &quot;Natural hickory flavoured&quot;.) In the worlds of
        logic and computing we find that same laudatory undertone in
        &quot;natural deduction&quot; and &quot;natural language
        (programming)&quot;. On closer scrutiny it is a euphemism for something
        like &quot;appealing to the uneducated&quot;.<br>
							<br>
							
        The adjective is acceptable in the technical term &quot;natural
        logarithm&quot; and &quot;natural numbers&quot; (provided the latter
        start at zero).<br>
							<br>
							Equally objectionable is the pejorative usage of &quot;artificial&quot;. The nicest examples of such usage was given by the high military expert who declared that &quot;obviously NATO is not interested in artificially simplified languages such as Pascal&quot;. Must we conclude that defence prefers naturally complicated languages? (Ada seems to confirm that conclusion.)</p>
        <p><br>
							<u>intuition</u><br>
							<br>
							
        My Pocket Oxford Dictionary --which requires a rather large pocket--
        defines &quot;intuition: immediate apprehension by the mind without
        reasoning&quot;. If we don't believe in miracles, we seem to have only
        two possibilities: either the reasoning required is so short and
        standard that it is hardly worth being recorded or mentioned, or the
        &quot;immediate apprehension&quot; does not amount to much. In the first
        case &quot;intuitively clear&quot; means</p>
        <div align="right">
							<hr>
							<a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/ewd08xx/EWD800.PDF">EWD800</a>-<a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/ewd08xx/EWD800.PDF#page=3">2</a></div>
        <p>&quot;obvious&quot;,
        in the second case it probably means no more than the absence of obvious
        counterexamples. In both cases, mathematical texts
        &quot;recommended&quot; for their appeal to the reader's intuition
        should be ignored, for such texts promote non-reasoning instead of
        better reasoning.<br>
							<br>
							
        Despite the above, there are still people that believe that intuition is
        a good thing; there is no point in arguing with them for they prefer to
        believe in miracles.</p>
        <p><br>
							<u>views of data</u><br>
							<br>
							
        I never talk about (different!) &quot;views of data&quot;. Not only can
        I do without them, but I have even the distinct impression that by
        talking about them people are more hampered than helped.<br>
