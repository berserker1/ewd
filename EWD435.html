<p>The following is a research proposal to investigate the linguistic
consequences when it is desired to program for a machine that could work
with an ultra-high degree of concurrency. The subject has been suggested by
the advent of LSI-techinques that store large amounts of information on
essentially active components: once in the far future we may be invited
to think of algorithms instructing machines, such that the major part of
the logical manipulations will take place distributed all through &ldquo;the
store&rdquo;.
<p>It is felt that the above invitation could have a deep linguistic
consequence: if the purpose of the whole game is a drastic reduction of
computation time, we may expect both a reduction of the number of &ldquo;instructions&rdquo;
to be executed and of the number of &ldquo;instructions&rdquo; to be written down. One
way of trying to achieve a similar goal is the introduction of large fancy
data-types, upon which numerous, powerful operations are defined, the
implementation of which allows a considerable &mdash;&ldquo;internal&rdquo;, if you wish&mdash;
concurrency. Efforts along those lines that we are aware of, are, however,
on this macroscopic scale still purely sequential, at each moment only a
very small number of such fancy operands will be actually involved in the
computational process. We would like to go a considerable step further, at
each moment involving &ldquo;all of the storage contents&rdquo; so to speak in the
activity.
<p>To achieve the high degree of concurrency by asking the programmer to
regulate &mdash;i.e. synchronize etc.&mdash; explicitly the co-operation between a
huge number of possibly all different concurrent sequential processes, seems
a dead alley in the sense that the implied programming task will quickly
exceed our abilities. It seems more attractive to look for a simple and
systematic instruction repertoire such that each &ldquo;instruction&rdquo; can interfere
in a homogeneous fashion with the total contents of the store. Its interference
must be homogeneous, because otherwise there is no hope that we, as programmers,
will be able to manage the beast.
<p>In order to avoid misunderstandings, we would like to point out that it
is most emphatically not our intention to design a machine. Our &ldquo;instruction
repertoire&rdquo; can, of course, be interpreted as the functional specifications
of a machine; in choosing this instruction repertoire, however, we do not
feel ourselves obliged to restrict ourselves in such a way that the 
corresponding machine could be built realistically with current-day technology.
We are perfectly willing to consider functional specifications that would
make most hardware designers shudder at the thought of having to build
something meeting them! Our primary concern is that the machine will be
manageable from the programmers point of view.
<p>In one specific aspect we feel ourselves obliged to be kind to the
poor hardware engineer or &mdash;to put in another way&mdash; to leave the door open:
our goal is to write down understandable programs under control of which a
highly concurrent activity is possiblie, but not obligatory. An (obvious)
underlying desire is to arrange our programs in such a fashion that, in
spite of the high potential concurrency, most of the in the mean time developed
techniques for the programming of sequential processes remain applicable;
(We expect to maintain the &ldquo;semicolons&rdquo; but would like powerful &ldquo;statements&rdquo;
in between!)
<p>As understandability is one of our primary concerns, we shall certainly
at the start allow ourselves the luxury that is characteristic of the 
so-called &ldquo;higher programming languages&rdquo;, viz. arbitrarily complicated expressions
as components of our commands. In classical environments it is well-known
how the evaluation of an arbitrarily complicated (algebraic) expression
can be broken down such that a (very) finite arithmetic unit can produce
the result. For the time being we just hope that the &ldquo;breaking down&rdquo; of our
expressions will not present unsurmountable logical difficulties.
<p align="center" class="noindent">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>*</p> 
<p>Highly associative techniques seem indicated for two reasons. Firstly,
associative techniques are a way of distributing an activity (viz. comparing)
all through the store; secondly, the potential but not obligatory concurrency
could very well make the storage management problem as is cuased by a store
consisting of explicitly addressed cells, unmanageable. The desire to use
something that smells like &ldquo;association&rdquo; is a direct consequence of our
desire to broadcast commands that all through the store will be processed
in a &ldquo;homogeneous&rdquo; fashion.
<p>Having abolished addresses, we have to introduce &ldquo;names&rdquo;. We assume the
machine able to deal with (values of) variables of type &ldquo;name&rdquo;, we assume the
cardinality of this type to be high enough. &ldquo;To deal with&rdquo; will certainly
include the ability to test the equality of two names (as with all types!).
Assuming all entities to be referred to, to be indentified by mutually
distinct names, any relation between some of these entities can be represented
by a relation between their names. If &ldquo;p<sub>1</sub>&rdquo; through &ldquo;P<sub>100</sub>&rdquo; stand for the
distinct names of 100 different persons, we may have the relations
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=18%>
fatherof(p<sub>i</sub>, p<sub>j</sub>)</td><td>meaning: &ldquo;p<sub>i</sub> is the father of p<sub>j</sub>&rdquo; and
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>
olderthan(p<sub>i</sub>, p<sub>j</sub>)</td><td>meaning: &ldquo;p<sub>i</sub> is older than p<sub>j</sub>&rdquo; .
</td>  </tr>  </table>
(We then know, for instance, that for any i and j
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
      fatherof(p<sub>i</sub>, p<sub>j</sub>) &rArr; olderthan(p<sub>i</sub>, p<sub>j</sub>) </td> </tr>
</table>
buth not the other way round!)
<p>Instead of representing &ldquo;all sorts of relations&rdquo; &mdash;such as &ldquo;fatherof&rdquo;
or &ldquo;olderthan&rdquo;&mdash; we choose the more general &mdash;and neutral!&mdash; technique of
considering different relations as &ldquo;named entities&rdquo; as well,&mdash;e.g. named
by &ldquo;fatherof&rdquo; and &ldquo;olderthan&rdquo; respectively&mdash;, leaving us with a single
universal relations &mdash;which, therefore, can remain anonymous&mdash; and represent
&ldquo;(fatherof, p<sub>i</sub>, p<sub>j</sub>)&rdquo; and &ldquo;(olderthan, p<sub>i</sub>, p<sub>j</sub>)&rdquo;.
<p>(Note that we could also have &ldquo;(implies, fatherof, olderthan)&rdquo; ! This
is to stress that what from one point of view was regarded as &ldquo;a relation&rdquo;,
from another point of view can be regarded as &ldquo;an argument&rdquo;.)
<p>Such an ordered n-tuple of names is called: an &ldquo;associon&rdquo;. The contents
of the store is considered to be an unordered set of (different) associons.
The presence of an associon in store will be interpreted as the truth of the
universal relation applied to its arguments, i.e. the members of the n-tuple.
<p class="noindent"><b>Note 1</b>. For the time being we shall not worry about arithmetic. If so
desired we could postulate &mdash;i.e. bring into store&mdash; the following collection
of associons:
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=20%>
(integer, zero)</td><td>(nought, zero)
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>
(integer, one)</td><td>(suc, zero, one)
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>
(integer, two)</td><td>(suc, one, two)
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>
etc.</td><td>etc.
</td>  </tr>  </table>
as many as we like. (End of note 1.)
<p class="noindent"><b>Note 2</b>. Many relations are symmetric. As the possibilities are numerous, we
shall not make up our mind now. For the time being, we can assume that
whenever &ldquo;(asoldas, p<sub>i</sub>, p<sub>j</sub>)&rdquo; is in store, &ldquo;(asoldas, p<sub>j</sub>, p<sub>i</sub>)&rdquo; will be in
store as well. (Alternatively, we could store besides the specific associon
&ldquo;(asoldas, p<sub>i</sub>, p<sub>j</sub>)&rdquo; the general &ldquo;(twosym, asoldas)&rdquo;.) (End of note 2.)
<p>Names occurring as elements of associons in store may occur as constants
in our program texts: this facility should enable us to refer to subclasses
of associons, e.g. all 3-tuples with &ldquo;fatherof&rdquo; in the leading position. We
may expect that as the computation proceeds, new names have to be generated:
such a new name will be different from any name occurring anywhere in an
associon in store or as a constant in our program. We can restrict the
rule to &ldquo;different from any name occurring in an associon in store&rdquo; when
reading in a program , in which the name &ldquo;fatherof&rdquo; occurs, gives rise to
an 1-tuple associon &ldquo;(fatherof)&rdquo; in store. As the creation of associons
must anyhow be something that can be ordered by a program, its opening
statement could start by greeting these associons, thereby reserving the
unique meaning of its constants.
<p align="center" class="noindent">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>*</p> 
<p>The presence of associons in store is interpreted as recorded truths
of facts. The evaluation of a computation is view as the creation of new
associons, recording the truths of facts that are implied by already known
truths. One truth is fairly universla, it is the truth of &ldquo;<b>true</b>&rdquo;; this will
be recorded by the irrevocable presence in store of the empty associon &ldquo;()&rdquo;.
when we refer to &ldquo;an empty store&rdquo;, this means &ldquo;a store containing only &ldquo;()&rdquo;&rdquo;.
<p>Besides creating new associons, we shall also &mdash;&ldquo;to save storage space&rdquo;!&mdash;
cater for the destruction of associons. This may represent the abolishment
of records of truths still valid, but no longer of any interest &mdash;e.g. at the
end of a computation, an abolishment, very similar to the traditional block
exit&mdash;, it may also represent that, from now onwards, a (transient) 
interpretation is no longer valid. In all probability, this second need for
associon destruction will only emerge as soon as explicit repetitive mechanisms
are introduced.
<p class="noindent"><b>Note</b>. The insertion &ldquo;to save storage space&rdquo; was not made jokingly: destruction
of information seems characteristic of all non-trivial machine usage. (End
of note)
<p>Above, we have said that the creation of new associons would take
place as a recording of truths implied by already recorded truths. To do
justice to this observation, we propose &mdash;as a rather fundamental language
construct&mdash; to use the implication for that purpose. Creating the two
associons &ldquo;(fatherof)&rdquo; and &ldquo;(olderthan)&rdquo; could take place by
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
     () &rArr; (fatherof) <b>and</b> (olderthan) </td> </tr>
</table>
or by
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
     () &rArr; (fatherof); ()&rArr; (olderthan) . </td> </tr>
</table>
The idea is that, upon completion of such a statement the &ldquo;stated
implication&rdquo; holds. If the implication holds to start with, it will act as
the empty statement, if not, however, it will react to it by creating missing
associons as mentioned at the right-hadn side and not by removing &ldquo;()&rdquo;.
(This is not unlike the asymmetry of the ALGOL 60 assignment statement &ldquo;x:= y&rdquo;.)
<p class="noindent"><b>Note</b>. For the time being we assume that the semicolon indicates successive
execution in the usual way. (End of note.)
<p>The Sheffer Stroke suggests, that we must be able to negate as well;
the negation of the left-hand side presents no problem, the creation of
&ldquo;(fatherof)&rdquo; could then also be prescribed by the (longer) statement:
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
      <b>non</b> (fathers?) &rArr; (fatherof) . </td> </tr>
</table>
If &ldquo;(fatherof)&rdquo; is present, the implication holds; otherwise, in order to
make the right-hand side true, the associon &ldquo;(fatherof)&rdquo; is created, whereafter
the implication holds. (That in the mean time, the left-hand side has become
false, is an admissible side-effect, that does not invalidate that the
implication still holds.)
<p align="center" class="noindent">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>*</p> 
<p>The above suggests a notation for destruction of associons, viz.
precede by a negation at the right.hand side, e.g.
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
      () &rArr; <b>non</b> (fatherof) <b>and</b> <b>non</b> (olderthan) </td> </tr>
</table>
or
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
      () &rArr; <b>non</b> (fatherof); () &rArr; <b>non</b> (olderthan) . </td> </tr>
</table>
Just as the creation can be described without using the universal truth &ldquo;()&rdquo;,
so can the destruction, viz.
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
      (fatherof) &rArr;<b>non</b> (fatherof) . </td> </tr>
</table>
<p align="center" class="noindent">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>*</p> 
<p>In our previous examples the liberty we had when positive terms at the
right-hand side could be created or negative terms at the right-hand side could
be destroyed was, that as an equation, the implication had only one solution.
But what, for constants &ldquo;A&rdquo;, &ldquo;B&rdquo; and &ldquo;C&rdquo;, about
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
      (A) &rArr; (B) ? </td> </tr>
</table>
If initially (A) holds, and (B) doesn&rsquo;t, an associon &ldquo;(B)&rdquo; will be created,
but when initially (A) is false, both presence and absence of (B) would
satisfy the implication. Viewing (B) as stating a fact that can be concluded
from the truth of (A), it is not allowed to create (B) &mdash;establish that
truth!&mdash; when (A) does not hold. If, however, the truth of (B) had already
been established otherwise, it will remain so. In other words: if (A)
does not hold, (B) is left as it is and the little program:
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
      (A) &rArr; (C); (B) &rArr; (C) </td> </tr>
</table>
it equivalent to (A) <b>or</b> (B) &rArr; (C) .
In other words (A) &rArr; (B) will only change the store contents, when initially
(A) <b>and</b> <b>non</b> (B) holds. As long as constant are involved, the above shows that
we do not need the <b>or</b> as a connective at the left-hand side. The connective
<b>or</b> at the right-hand side, e.g.
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
      (A) &rArr; (B) <b>or</b> (C) </td> </tr>
</table>
is still more misplaced: even if the implication is true, we may not 
arbitrarily conclude either the truth of (B) or (E) or of both. For the time
being, the connective &ldquo;<b>or</b>&rdquo; will not be used anymore. (The introduction of <b>or</b>
at the right-hand side is certainly not a good way of introducing 
non-determinacy.)
<p align="center" class="noindent">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>*</p> 
<p>Also the and at the right-hand side should be used with precaution, such
as is shown by the trivial example
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
      () &rArr; (A) <b>and</b> <b>non</b> (A) . </td> </tr>
</table>
For the time being we shall therefore not use the <b>and</b> at the right-hand
side anymore. (Time will show!)
<p>Our format for the left-hand side is new reduced to a conjunction of
terms, for the right-hand side to a single term, where a term is a possibly
negated associon.
