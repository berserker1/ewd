<p class=noindent><b>A correction on EWD651</b>.
<p>The day after I had mailed the copies of EWD651 to its various recipients
I discovered that it was miserably wrong: the transfer from the L-group to
the R-group did not work properly. In the new version the boolean L is
replaced by the four-valued integer k . &rsquo;
<p>A notational difference is the introduction of the integers pL and
pH , counting the numbers of blocked processes in the L-group and in the
R-group respectively. The former variables wL and wR have disappeared,
their values being pL - nL and
pR - nR respectively.
<p>The integer k controls whether a process with a false guard will
arrive in the L-group or in the R-group. In contrast to EWD651, in which
the value of L was left undefined when both groups were empty, we have now
decided that the first process to be blocked will come in the R-group, thus
being faithful to the intention of maintaining m = 0 <b>or</b> pL = 0 <b>or</b> pR &gt; 0 .
Initially we have k = 1 . We shall now describe the meaning of the variable k.
<p class=noindent><b>k = 0 </b>.
<p>The process finding its guard false either just entered the critical
activity via P(m) or is retesting its guard; in the latter case it came from
the L-group. In either case it is directed towards the L-group. During the
test of a guard with k = 0, we have pR = nR &gt; 0 , and all the processes in
the R-group have a false guard.
<p class=noindent><b>k = 1 </b>.
<p>If the process finding its guard false just entered the critical activity
via P(m), we had pL = pR = 0 , and the process is entered into the R-group.
If the process finding its guard false is retesting its guard, it came from
the R-group and returns to it, and the values of the guards of the processes
in the L-group &mdash;if any&mdash; are unknown.
<p class=noindent><b>k = 2 </b>.
<p>This state, which is one of the transfer states, cannot occur with m = 1,
                       
hence a process finding its guard false has not just entered the critical
activity. The process that is retesting its guard came from the L-group and
will be directed into the R-group. The state k &ge; 2 remains until the L-group
is empty, so as to ensure that <b>all</b> L-processes escape or become an R-process
before a new process is admitted via P(m) . This is done in order to 
exclude infinite overtaking of a process in the L-group. During k = 2 we
have pR = nR , and all processes in the R-group &mdash;if any&mdash; have a false
guard.
<p class=noindent><b>k = 3 </b>.
<p>This second transfer state can also not occur with m = 1 . It is only
entered when in the &ldquo;middle&rdquo; of the transfer of processes from the L-group
to the R-group &mdash;i.e. when k = 2 &mdash; one of the processes escapes via S .
As soon as that has happened, we are no longer sure that all processes in the
R-group have a false guard. Therefore all the processes in the R-group have
to retest their guard before the transfer from the L-group to the R-group
can be resumed. When with k = 3 a process finds its guard false, it came
from the R-group and will be returned to the R-group, just as in state k = 1
The values of the guards of the processes in the L-group &mdash;if any&mdash; are 
unknown, when it has been established that the R-group only contains processes
with a false guard and the L-group is not empty, the transfer will be resumed
with k = 2.
<p>When, with pR &gt; 0 , it has been established that all processes in the
R-group have a false guard &mdash; pR = nR &mdash; the primary case distinction is
whether the L-group is empty or not. In the first case, the critical activity
is terminated via V(m) with k = 0 , because a new process that blocks itself,
should do so in the L-group. In the second case &mdash;because when processes
from the R-group are tested, the guards of those in the L-group are never
known&mdash; those in the L-group have to retest their guard. The last process
(re)entering the R-group did so with k: 1, 2, or 3 ; the L-testing has to
be resumed with k = 0, 2, 2 respectively, hence the

blocked process should be entered into the R-group. Otherwise testing is
resumed with priority to the R-group. If the R-group is empty &mdash;possible
values of k are 1, 2, and 3 &mdash; the transfer from the L-group to the R-group
is started or continued with k = 2 , because the R-group (being empty) contains
                
no processes with a possibly true guard. If the R-group is not empty, the
testing of the R-group is started or continued. The S has been executed
with k = 0, 1, 2, or 3 ; testing will be resumed with k = 1, 1, 3, 3 , hence

independent of the question whether the L-group is empty or not.
<p class=noindent><b>Note</b>. The integer k was introduced when I had discovered the need for the
state k = 2 , but not yet the need for the state k = 3 . Had I foreseen
that fourth state, I would have used a second boolean , tf say (&ldquo;transfer&rdquo;),
and would have coded

respectively. (End of note.)
<p>I can only describe the blunder of EWD651 as &ldquo;most instructive&rdquo;, because
I know exactly how it occurred: we did not stick to our own rules, fell back
into our old bad habits and rushed into coding! Besides that the whole 
experience provides a (totally unintended but welcome) confirmation of my often
stated conjecture that pictures give a false sense of security. Although
somewhat humiliated I am actually glad that I blundered so clearly!
<p>I wish everybody a happy 1978!
