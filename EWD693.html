<p class=noindent><b>About polygons in Detroit</b>.
<p>After my trip from Nuenen to Detroit I suffered, as usual, from the
six-hour time shift, and, in bed but hopelessly awake, I posed myself the
problem, what shape a polygon with sides of given lengths would take if the
enclosed area had to be of maximum value. With the polygon built from rigid
sides, in their endpoints flexibly joined to their two neighbours, the shape
enclosing the maximum area is stable when a constant outward pressure p is
exerted on all sides; hence the resulting outward force on each side is
compensated by the forces of reaction exerted upon it by its two neighbours.
<IMG SRC="EWD693IM.png" NAME="polygon" BORDER=0> 
<p>The outward force resulting from the pressure p exerted on a side of
length b equals p.b , applied to its midpoint in a direction orthogonal
to it. The stability of the side requires that the parallel components of
the two reaction forces cancel, and that their orthogonal components be
p.b/2 . Hence the two reaction forces have the same value, f say, and
make the same angle, &beta; say, with the side, the four quantities being 
related by
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
</td><td>p.b = 2.f.sin(&beta;)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
<p>In each endpoint we now draw a line orthogonal to the force of 
reaction, and call the point where these two lines meet M . Because the two
lines meet at an angle 2.&beta; , and the point M lies at the same distance,
r say, from the two endpoints, we have
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
</td><td> b = 2.r.sin(&beta;) .
</td>  </tr>  </table>
            
Combining the above two relations we derive
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%>  </td><td valign=top>
r = f/p .</td><td align=right>(1)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
Observing the same value f in two successive joints, and knowing the
physical law &ldquo;action = reaction&rdquo;, we conclude that we have the <b>same</b> value f
for the forces of reaction in <b>all</b> joints. In each joint the orthogonals to
the forces of reaction, which have opposite directions, coincide, and from
(1) we now conclude that all vertices have the same distance r from the
point M . Hence we have proved that the vertices of the polygon with
given lengths of its sides and with maximum enclosed area lie on a circle.
<p>Because the interchange of two neighbouring sides leaves the area 
enclosed and the radius of the circumscribed circle invariant, we conclude that
the maximum area enclosed and the radius of the circumscribed circle only 
depend on the lengths of the sides, but not on the order in which these lengths
occur along the circumference.
