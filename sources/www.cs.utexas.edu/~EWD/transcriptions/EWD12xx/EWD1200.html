				<p class="noindent"><u>Only a matter of style?</u></p>
				<p>For educational purposes we analyse the opening pages of an 11-page article that appeared in <i>The American Mathematical Monthly</i>, Volume 102 Number 2 / February 1995. We added line numbers in the right margin.</p>
				<p class="noindent">line 4: Since in this article, squares don&rsquo;t get alternating colours, it could be argued that the term &ldquo;chessboard&rdquo; is misplaced.</p>
				<p class="noindent">line 4: The introduction of the name &ldquo;<var>B</var>&rdquo; seems unnecessary: it is used &#x2014;in the combination &ldquo;the board <var>B</var>&rdquo;&#x2014; in the text for Figure 1 and in line 71; in both cases just &ldquo;the board&rdquo; would have done fine. In line 77 occurs the last use of <var>B</var>, viz. in &ldquo;<var>X</var>&nbsp;<span class="unicode">&#x2282;</span>&nbsp;<var>B</var>&rdquo;, which is dubious since <var>B</var> was a board and not a set; in line 77, I would have preferred &ldquo;Given a set <var>X</var> of cells&rdquo;.</p>
				<p class="noindent">line 7/8: The first move, being a move like any other, does not deserve a separate description. The term &ldquo;step&rdquo; is redundant.</p>
				<p class="noindent">line 8: Why not &ldquo;a move consists of&rdquo;?</p>
				<p class="noindent">line 10/11: At this stage the italics are puzzling, since a move is possible if, for some <var>i</var>,&thinsp;<var>j</var>, cell (<var>i</var>,&thinsp;<var>j</var>) contains a pebble and cells (<var>i</var>+1,<var>&thinsp;j</var>) and (<var>i</var>,&thinsp;<var>j</var>+1) are empty.</p>
				<p class="noindent">line 10: Twice the term &ldquo;positions&rdquo; for what everywhere else is called &ldquo;cells&rdquo;.</p>
				<p class="noindent">line 12: Why not &ldquo;After <var>k</var> moves the board had <var>k</var>+1 pebbles on it&rdquo;?</p>
				<p class="noindent">line 12/14: In the one sentence, <var>k</var> counts moves, in the other <var>k</var> counts pebbles. Since the prose does not indicate the scope of dummies, this double use of the same <var>k</var> is a little bit unforgivable.</p>
				<p class="noindent">line 14: &ldquo;and we set <var>R</var> := <span class="unicode">&#x222A;</span><sub><var>k</var>&#x2265;1</sub> <var>R</var>(<var>k</var>)&rdquo;. We remark<br />
					&#x2022; &nbsp; the use of the verb &ldquo;to set&rdquo; when defining (the set!) <var>R</var> can be considered unfortunate<br />
					&#x2022; &nbsp; since &ldquo;<var>R</var>&rdquo; is not used on the next two pages, the name seems to be introduced too early<br />
					&#x2022; &nbsp; the introduction of the name <var>R</var> seems unnecessary; in the rest of the paper I saw it used once in &ldquo;any <var>C</var>&nbsp;<span class="unicode">&#x2208;</span>&nbsp;<var>R</var>&rdquo;, where &ldquo;any reachable configuration&rdquo; would have done. (<em>Note</em>. In the context in question &#x2014;p&nbsp;116&#x2014; the reachable context can remain anonymous: the quoted occurrence of <var>C</var> is the <em>only</em> occurrence of the identifier <var>C</var> in that context. My conclusion is that the reachable configuration has been called <var>C</var> only in order to admit the boolean expression <var>C</var>&nbsp;<span class="unicode">&#x2208;</span>&nbsp;<var>R</var>.)<br />
					&#x2022; &nbsp; the authors have chosen a special symbol for what is sometimes referred to as &ldquo;definitional equality&rdquo;; they are not the only ones to do so, but I would like to remark that I have never seen a proper justification of the convention (nor can I think of one)<br />
					&#x2022; &nbsp; after the introduction of ALGOL60, the mathematical community has adopted the latter&rsquo;s assignment operator as symbol for &ldquo;definitional equality&rdquo;, thereby only adding to the confusion since assignment has nothing to do with equality (vide <var>x</var>:=<var>x</var>+1)<br />
					&#x2022; &nbsp; identifier <var>R</var> has been given two meanings, in particular the type of <var>R</var> is no longer defined: the one <var>R</var> is of the type &ldquo;set of cells&rdquo;, the other <var>R</var> is of type &ldquo;natural number&rdquo; &#x2192; &ldquo;set of cells&rdquo;.
				</p>
				<p class="noindent">line 15: Why not &ldquo;the eight reachable configurations&rdquo;? The printed text raises the question of how a reachable configuration can be impossible.</p>
				<p class="noindent">line 17: The printed text refers to an obligation for pebbles; had it been &ldquo;some cell having coordinates (<var>i</var>,&thinsp;<var>j</var>) with <var>i</var>+<var>j</var>&nbsp;&#x2264;&nbsp;3 must contain a pebble&rdquo;, we would have had an obligation for cells! It is better to avoid this spurious dilemma by deleting &ldquo;must&rdquo; &#x2014;a verb that is usually better avoided&#x2014; and to write &ldquo;some pebble occupies a cell&rdquo; or &ldquo;some cell contains a pebble&rdquo;.</p>
				<p class="noindent">line 17/18: I think the authors meant &ldquo;This fact seems to have noted first by M.Kontsevich.&rdquo;</p>
				<p class="noindent">line 19/22: We remark<br />
					&#x2022; &nbsp; in a sentence of the structure &ldquo;If <var>L</var>(<var>k</var>) denotes the set {(<var>i</var>,&thinsp;<var>j</var>):&nbsp;<var>i</var>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<var>j</var>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<var>k</var>} then [.....].&rdquo; the scope of the convention stated in the antecedent ends at the end of the consequent; in this paper, the scope of <var>L</var>&rsquo;s definition extends through the whole paper!<br />
					&#x2022; &nbsp; in line 20, <var>L</var>(1) <span class="unicode">&#x222A;</span> <var>L</var>(2) <span class="unicode">&#x222A;</span> <var>L</var>(3) should be <var>L</var>(0) <span class="unicode">&#x222A;</span> <var>L</var>(1) <span class="unicode">&#x222A;</span> <var>L</var>(2) <span class="unicode">&#x222A;</span> <var>L</var>(3); <var>L</var>(0) is also missing in Lemma 2.<br />
					&#x2022; &nbsp; in line 21, delete &ldquo;must always&rdquo;: &ldquo;any reachable configuration has a pebble...&rdquo;. [Now I come to think of it, &ldquo;some cell&rdquo; is okay, for the cells are distinguished by their coordinates; &ldquo;some pebble&rdquo; is nonsense, for the pebbles are as indistinguishable as the electrons in the helium atom.]<br />
				</p>
				<p class="noindent">line 38, 45, 47 &amp; 49: add &ldquo;<var>L</var>(0) <span class="unicode">&#x222A;</span>&rdquo;.</p>
				<p class="noindent">line 39: It is a pity that the weight of cell (<var>i</var>,&thinsp;<var>j</var>) has been given as <span class="nowrap">2<sup>&#x2212;(<var>i</var>+<var>j</var>)</sup></span>, instead of as (½)<sup><var>i</var>+<var>j</var></sup> or rather (½)<sup><var>i</var></sup>&nbsp;·&nbsp;(½)<sup><var>j</var></sup>, the latter being a special case of <var>p</var><sup><var>i</var></sup>·<var>q</var><sup><var>j</var></sup> with <var>p</var>+<var>q</var>=1. (The latter equality equivales the requirement that a move does not change the total weight covered.) The unproved statement about the boundaries &#x2014;line 53/55&#x2014; follows via (<var>p</var>,<var>&thinsp;q</var>)=(1,0) and (<var>p</var>,<var>&thinsp;q</var>)=(0,1)</p>
				<p class="noindent">line 42: I would prefer &ldquo;the total weight of the cells covered&rdquo;; as printed, it might be misread as &ldquo;the weights of cells covered&rdquo;. I would also prefer &ldquo;covered&rdquo; replaced by &ldquo;occupied&rdquo;, the term used before.</p>
				<p class="noindent">line 52, 56, 58, 60: add &ldquo;<var>L</var>(0) <span class="unicode">&#x222A;</span>&rdquo;.</p>
				<p class="noindent">line 55: replace &ldquo;which&rdquo; by &ldquo;that&rdquo;. (That was easy.).</p>
				<p class="noindent">line 55/59: These two sentences have baffled me for at least 15 minutes &#x2014;and this was when I really got cross with the authors&#x2014;. Forget about minor problems such as &ldquo;weight covered&rdquo; &#x2014;on top of this page [line 42], cells were the things being <span class="nowrap">covered&#x2014;;</span> what hit me was &ldquo;can&rdquo; in line 55 and &ldquo;these cells&rdquo; in line 58. Eventually I realized that the verb &ldquo;can&rdquo; hints at a hidden inequality: the conclusion that should have been drawn is that the total weight of the cells outside <var>L</var>(0) <span class="unicode">&#x222A;</span> <var>L</var>(1) <span class="unicode">&#x222A;</span> <var>L</var>(2) but with only one cell from each of the boundaries is <em>at most</em> 1. From line 58, &ldquo;must&rdquo; is again a candidate for deletion. Furthermore, authors should know that an obscure notion like &ldquo;these cells&rdquo; is not clarified by printing the preceding &ldquo;all&rdquo; in italics.</p>
				<p class="noindent">line 67/71: &ldquo;It might be helpful&rdquo;: helpful for what purpose and how? &ldquo;in this model&rdquo;: in which model? &ldquo;the pebbles first move&rdquo;: what is the meaning of &ldquo;first&rdquo;? The text mentions no &ldquo;later&rdquo; or &ldquo;second&rdquo;; &ldquo;are identified in the obvious way&rdquo;: how obvious?</p>
				<p class="noindent">line 74: delete &ldquo;in fact&rdquo;, as it does not contribute anything</p>
				<p class="noindent">line 75: the introduction of the adjective &ldquo;standard&rdquo;, which is used nowhere else, serves no purpose.</p>
				<p class="noindent">line 72: This sentence has no connection to what precedes it, and is closely connected to what follows it; this is not reflected in the vertical spacing, which obscures the logical structure of the text. Moreover, it would have been nice if &ldquo;the easy induction argument&rdquo; had been shown: a few colleagues and I spent 1½ hours on not finding it.</p>
				<p class="noindent">line 75: The introduction of the adjective &ldquo;standard&rdquo; as technical term is superfluous, since the term is not used in the rest of the paper.</p>
				<p class="noindent">line 77/81:
					&#x2022; This paragraph displays the (not uncommon) shortcoming that its logical relation to the rest of the text requires the study of its contents. Is it going to demonstrate Lemma 3 or is it an introduction to Theorem 1? (At first reading, I assumed the former, and got puzzled.)<br />
					&#x2022; &nbsp; It is elliptic: line 77 announces the definition of the set <var>M</var>(<var>X</var>), but lines 78 through 81 formally don&rsquo;t do so (they don&rsquo;t mention <var>M</var>(<var>X</var>)&nbsp;).<br />
					&#x2022; &nbsp; It is very obscure. The notation <var>M</var>(<var>X</var>) strongly suggests that the paragraph should define a function of type: &ldquo;set of cells&rdquo; &#x2192; &ldquo;set of moves&rdquo;. The text, however, describes a process that seems to depend on an initial distribution of pebbles. But there is more ambiguity. Suppose there are 2 cells, one in <var>X</var> and one not in <var>X</var>, but both containing pebbles; we are then to remove pebbles either from the one or from the other: how do we choose? Also, how do we &ldquo;remove all but at most one of the pebbles&rdquo;? For me, &ldquo;at most one&rdquo; is in natural numbers &ldquo;zero or one&rdquo;, but the removal of &ldquo;all but zero or one of the pebbles&rdquo; is too nondeterministic to define a function. For the dependence on the initial pebble distribution I can suggest a fix, but not for the rest of the ambiguities.

				<p>It is here that I gave up. When studying a paper I don&rsquo;t consider it my duty to conjecture what should have been written down.</p>

							Initially, a single &ldquo;pebble&rdquo; is located in cell (0,0) (the lower left corner; see Figure<br />

							located at cells (1,0) and (0,1), respectively. In general, a move will consist of<br />
