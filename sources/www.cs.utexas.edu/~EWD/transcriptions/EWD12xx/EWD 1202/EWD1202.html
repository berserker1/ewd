				<u>The complete (<var>n</var>+1)-graph in <var>n</var>-dimensional space</u>
				<p>We can embed the complete 2-graph with labelled vertices in a 1-dimensional world
				<br />
				<div align="center">
					<p class="noindent"><img src="graph2a.jpg" alt="vertices A and B with undirected arc AB" align="middle"> &nbsp; or &nbsp; <img src="graph2b.jpg" alt="vertices B and A with undirected arc BA" align="middle"></p></div>

				and if the two &quot;ends&quot; of that 1-dimensional world are distinct, the above 2 embeddings are different.
</p>
				<p>We can embed the complete 3-graph with labelled vertices in a 2-dimensional world
				<br />
				<div align="center">
					<p class="continue"><img src="graph3a.jpg" alt="triangle with vertices C, A, B (clockwise, starting at left)" align="middle"> &nbsp; or &nbsp; <img src="graph3b.jpg" alt="triangle with vertices B, A, C (clockwise, starting at left)" align="middle"></p></div>
				
					
				<p class="continue">
				and if the two &quot;sides&quot; of the plane are distinct, so are the 2 embeddings.
</p>
				<p>Similarly &#x2014;and this will be our last example&#x2014; the completed 4-graph can be embedded in 2 ways in directed 3-space &#x2014;i.e. a 3-dimensional world that is distinct from its mirror image&#x2014;
				<br />
				<div align="center"><img src="graph4a.jpg" alt="tetrahedron with vertices C, B, D clockwise in horizontal plane and vertex A above" align="middle"> &nbsp; or &nbsp; <img src="graph4b.jpg" alt="tetrahedron with vertices B, C, D clockwise in horizontal plane and vertex A above" align="middle"> &nbsp; .</div>
				<p>The first question to be raised and answered is: how do we distinguish, for each number of dimensions, between the 2 embeddings?
					Moreover we would like to do so in a manner that does not destroy the symmetry between the vertices.</p>
				<p>Here the theory of inversions &#x2014;i.e. (the number of) pairs of elements out of order&#x2014; gives the answer. For any <var>k</var>, <var>k</var> &#x2265 2, the <var>k</var>! permutation of <var>k</var> elements can be partitioned into 2 classes of equal size such that a single swap transforms any permutation of the one class into a permutation of the other class.
					For elements <var>A</var>, <var>B</var>, the classes are {<var>AB</var>} and {<var>BA</var>},
					for elements <var>A</var>, <var>B</var>, <var>C</var>, the classes are {<var>ABC</var>, <var>BCA</var>, <var>CAB</var>} and {<var>ACB</var>, <var>BAC</var>, <var>CBA</var>},
					for elements <var>A</var>, <var>B</var>, <var>C</var>, <var>D</var>, the one class is {<var>ABCD</var>, <var>ACDB</var>, <var>ADBC</var>, <var>BADC</var>, <var>BCAD</var>, <var>BDCA</var>, <var>CABD</var>, <var>CBDA</var>, <var>CDAB</var>, <var>DACB</var>, <var>DBAC</var>, <var>DCBA</var>} and the construction of the other class is left to the reader.
					I would like to stress that the existence and &quot;shape&quot; of these classes have nothing to do with the labels <var>A</var>,<var>B</var>,<var>C</var>,&#x2026; or their alphabetic order: they are intrinsically generated by the process of permuting.
					The two classes provide the answer to our first question: for any <var>k</var>, we associate the one class with the one embedding, and the other class with the other embedding.</p>
				<p>The &quot;oriented&quot; (<var>n</var>+1)-graph has <var>n</var>+1 &quot;faces&quot;, one opposite to each vertex. The way to give those faces an orientation in a systematic manner is, for instance, as follows: choose from the representative class for the (<var>n</var>+1)-graph a permutation that starts with the opposite vertex and select the rest of that permutation.
					So the oriented 3-graph with class {<var>ABC</var>, <var>BCA</var>, <var>CAB</var>} has face <var>BC</var> opposite to <var>A</var>, face <var>CA</var> opposite to <var>B</var> and face <var>AB</var> opposite to <var>C</var>;
					the 4-graph corresponding to <var>ABCD</var> has the 4 oriented faces corresponding to <var>BCD</var>, <var>ADC</var>, <var>ABD</var>, and <var>ACB</var> respectively, and any 2 of them contain the subface they share in opposite orientation:
					e.g. <var>BCD</var> and <var>ADC</var> contain <var>CD</var> and <var>DC</var> respectively, the one having been obtained by truncating a leading <var>AB</var> (from <var>ABCD</var>, as a matter of fact), the other by truncating a leading <var>BA</var> (from <var>BADC</var>).
					Generalization to more dimensions is left to the reader.</p>
