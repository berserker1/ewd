I beg you to read it as carefully as you think it deserves to be read, as I am very anxious to get whatever comments you feel tempted to make.</p>								<p>I am presently engaged in an investigation of what is implied by (and what benefits could be derived from) the design of a highly layered, tree-structured programming system. One of my goals is to arrange matters in such a fashion that &quot;adding another layer to the system&quot; at top side is very much like &quot;feeding in a user program&quot;; another goal is to arrange matters in such a fashion that at bottom side a number of the lower layers could (at least conceptually) be absorbed by the hardware. In its present stage, this project is hardly fit for discussion, I am just tentatively playing with vague concepts, trying to shape them so that they nicely fit together, I am still looking for the good words, the helpful metaphors.</p>								<p>But this work will be heavily influenced by my past thinking as reflected in EWD249 and therefore I solicit your comments most eagerly. An additional reason to ask for the benefits of your varied experience is the fact that my personal professional experience, although gathered over a considerable period of time, is very one-sided, so one-sided in fact, that I may have overlooked major implications of the programmer's task.</p>								<p>That is why I am grateful for the opportunity to throw EWD249 before the wolves. May the wolves enjoy it!</p>								<p>Looking forward to meeting you in Copenhagen,</p>							</div>							<div id="content">								<div align="center">									<p class="noindent">yours ever</p>									<p>&nbsp;</p>									<p style="text-indent:2in">Edsger W.Dijkstra</p>								</div>								<hr>								<!-- name and date --></div>							<div id="content" align="left">								<div id="footer" align="left">									<font size="-1">													transcribed by Reynir He&icirc;berg Stef&aacute;nsson<br>																							 revised <csobj format="MedDate" h="13" region="15" t="DateTime" w="90">Fri, 14 Aug 2009</csobj></font></div>							</div>						</div>			</div>		</body></html></x-html>
