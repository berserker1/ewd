<u>A (new?) proof of a theorem of Euler's on partitions.</u>
<p>
<u>Euler's theorem</u>. For any natural number N, the number of bags of (not necessarily distinct) odd natural nubers whose sum is N equals the number of sets of (distinct) positive integers whose sum is N.
<p>
<u>Proof</u>. In this proof:
<table>
<tr><td width="10%" align="right">i's</td><td>stand for positive integers,</td></tr>
<tr><td width="10%" align="right">q's</td><td>stand for odd natural numbers, and</td></tr>
<tr><td width="10%" align="right">t's</td><td>stand for powers of 2.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Euler's theorem follows from a 1-1 correspondence between bags of q's and sets of i's with the same sum.
<p>
In order to construct the bag of q's corresponding to a given set of i's, we observe that for each i the factorization i=t&#x2022;q is unique, For each i in the set we put, with i=t&#x2022;q, t instances of q into the bag. The result is a bag of q's with the same sum.
<p>
In order to construct the set of i's corresponding to a given bag of q's, we observe that each natural f is uniquely the sum of distinct t's. For a q with f occurrences in the bag we put into the set the i's of the form t&#x2022;q for those distinct t's whose sum equals f. The result is a set of (distinct) i's

with the same sum.
<p>
Grouping the i's in the set by largest odd divisor we see that the two transformations are each other's inverse. (End of Proof).
<p>
I found the above proof shortly after I had <u>firmly</u> decided to discard Ferrer diagrams and similar pictorial "aids". I asked myself how I could derive simply a bag of q's in a sum-preserving manner from a given set of i's. Since I was heading for a bag (in which multiple occurrences are allowed) I investigated how I could transform in a sum-preserving manner the individual i's into bags of q's. With the above result.

P.S. By distributing the above I learned that the proof is already known.
