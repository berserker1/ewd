				<p>A "grid polygon&rdquo; is defined as a plane polygon whose vertices are the only grid points on its edges.</p>
				<p class="noindent"><u>Lemma</u> &nbsp; Consider a grid triangle with 1 interior grid point; the interior point is the centre of gravity of the triangle.</p>

				<p class="noindent">Asked about my progress, I showed these two, adding &ldquo;but I hate the case analysis and have as yet not shown that it is exhaustive&rdquo;. How right was I about my caveat! The above case analysis is <em>not</em> exhaustive &#x2014;there are infinitely many such triangles&#x2014; and, moreover, it is totally superfluous.</p>
				<p>I constructed these examples with the intention of convincing myself that grid triangles with 1 interior grid point do indeed exist. A stupid exercise, for if they don&rsquo;t exist, the theorem is vacuously correct; furthermore, it is notoriously ineffective to study a non-empty set by looking at some of its members.</p>
				<p>So we start afresh. The antecedent is about a grid triangle with 1 interior grid point, and the consequent is about a triangle and its centre of gravity. Start at the least familiar side, which is the antecedent. What can we say about a grid triangle with 1 interior point? By connecting the interior point with the vertices, we partition the original triangle into three grid triangles without interior grid points? A simpler concept!</p>
				<p>What can we say about a grid triangle without interior grid points? In a way, it should not be too big, but if we are at a loss as how to make this constraint more precise, we can look at the consequent: what can we say about the size of the three triangles a big triangle is partitioned into when the centre of gravity is connected to the three vertices? The three small triangles have the same area, and, conversely, when a triangle is thus partitioned into three triangles of equal area, the interior point is the centre of gravity.</p>
				<p>Since a grid triangle cannot be too small either we make a leap of faith and try to prove our theorem by showing that <em>all</em> grid triangles without interior grid points have the <em>same</em> area. Looking at the simplest example</p>
				<p class="noindent" align="center" style="margin-top: 0;"><img src="ewd1027_fig3.png" alt="EWD1027 figure 3" title="EWD1027 figure 3" /></p>
				<p class="noindent">we conclude that that area would have to be ½. This fractional value begs to be eliminated, for, after all, grid points are about integer values. Fortunately, each grid triangle is half of a grid parallelogram</p>
				<p class="noindent" align="center" style="margin-top: 0;"><img src="ewd1027_fig4.png" alt="EWD1027 figure 4" title="EWD1027 figure 4" /></p>
				<p class="noindent">and if the grid triangle is without interior grid point, so is the grid parallelogram. So we are left with the obligation to show that a grid parallelogram without interior grid points has an area 1. This is most briefly shown by tiling the plane by such parallelograms, thus establishing a one-to-one correspondence between parallelograms and grid points &#x2014; say, each parallelogram and its top-right vertex.</p>
				<p>I am endebted to Wolfgang Hinderer (from Karlsruhe) for drawing my attention to this argument.</p>
