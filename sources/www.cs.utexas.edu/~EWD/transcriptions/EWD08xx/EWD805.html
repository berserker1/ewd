        <p><font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">IFIP's TC2 and the
        Mathematical Centre in Amsterdam had organised a four-day
        &quot;International Symposium on Algorithmic Languages&quot; at the
        occasion of prof.dr.ir. A. van Wijngaarden's retirement as director of
        the Mathematical Centre.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">On Saturday morning
        Ria and I drove to Schiphol to collect prof.dr. W.M. Turski (from
        Warsaw) and prof.dr. A.P. Ershov (from Novosibirsk), who stayed the
        weekend with us in Nuenen. (It was well-organized: their planes landed
        10 minutes apart!) It was a very nice weekend; on Sunday afternoon we
        were joined by Femke, who first spoke for an hour Russian with Ershov
        and then exercised for more than two hours the pronunciation of Polish
        with Turski. The weekend gave Ershov the opportunity to absorb some of
        the six-hour time shift.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">On Monday morning we
        took the 8.06 train to Amsterdam Amstel, where we took a cab; at 9.35 we
        were at the Mathematical Centre, where the symposium was held. During
        the next four days we had plenty of opportunity to explore the Amsterdam
        public transport system: we were lodged in the International Centre of
        the Royal Tropical Institute, on Monday evening we had a reception in
        the Stedelijk Museum, on Tuesday evening van Wijngaarden gave a dinner
        to friends in the Rosarium, and on Wed-</font></p>

        <p><font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">nesday evening we had
        the Conference Dinner in the Lido at the Leidse Plein.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">As member of the
        Program Committee I knew that it would not be a very good conference;
        apparently the computing community had sensed this, for there were only
        about 125 participants. There were three invited talks on van
        Wijngaarden's role: Heinz Zemanek (re IFIP), Peter Naur (re ALGOL 60)
        and Wlad Turski (re ALGOL 68). All three talks were well-prepared and
        well-presented. Good technical talks were given by R. Schild (from
        Switzerland), B. Meyer (from France), M. Broy (from Germany), M. Sato
        (from Japan) and J.C. Reynolds (from the USA). I found J. Darlington
        (from the UK) again totally unconvincing; J. Backus (from the USA)
        caused grave disappointment. J.D. Roberts (from the UK) baffled his
        audience, D. de Champeaux (from the Netherlands) insulted it by the
        lousiness of his presentation. H.S. Warren (from the USA) spoke about
        his thesis topic (under Schwarz at NYU), which was remarkably foolish,
        and all the rest I found rather boring. We had woolly talks --about
        &quot;the user&quot; and &quot;the beginning programmer&quot;--; some of
        the more mathematical papers most definitely lacked the effectiveness
        that is so dear to me. For lack of submitted papers the presentation of
        each had been allotted 40 minutes and on the average this was too much.

        filled half their slot by defining</font></p>

        transitive closure!)</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">The conference quite
        clearly suffered from the fact that it had been organised in honour of
        van Wijngaarden, who was sitting in the front row. A number of speakers
        really deserved to be torn apart, but the audience did not do it (or the
        chairman did not allow it) for fear of spoiling the fun for van
        Wijngaarden.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Turski's closing
        speech was magnificent. Belonging to the famous &quot;minority&quot;
        that left W.G.2.1 in protest in 1968, he should never have been asked to
        talk about van Wijngaarden and ALGOL 68. He solved his problem by
        treating ALGOL 68 as a mistake carried through to perfection, giving van
        Wijngaarden the credit for the latter, and W.G.2.1 the blame for the
        first. It was a very subtle balance!</font></p>
