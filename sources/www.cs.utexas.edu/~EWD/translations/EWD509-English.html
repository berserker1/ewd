<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt"><B>First
speech, autumn 1975. </B></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">At the beginning of my lectures in
this semester, I would like get as many misunderstandings as possible
out of the way, which may exist or arise about these lectures. Why
are they organized? Or, split up: why would I give them and why would
you listen to them? </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">I bring these points up because I
discovered a few years ago that there exist barely recordable
misunderstandings: a significant fraction of my audience had
considered it a matter of course that I gave lectures because I was
paid for it, with that assumption putting an enormous cart before the
horse. Indeed, it is the other way around: because I give lectures, I
am getting paid for it. It was an echo of the misconception that was
in fashion at the end of the sixties, namely that professors would
derive their status from their professorship at an institution of
higher education, while de facto the institution of higher education
derives its status primarily from those whom she has been able to
attract as professor. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">If I do not give lectures because I
get paid for it, why then? My answer is simple: because without the
educational business, in which we transfer the cultural heritage,
that our ancestors have entrusted us, to our next generation, our
society would lapse into barbarism within half a century. In this
sense, the profession of educator is a moral duty, both to his ancestry and to his offspring. Though this consideration justifies a general
concern for education, &mdash;a concern which incidentally is not shared
by our Minister of Education and Science&mdash;, it does of course not
explain why I personally would commit myself. Ostensibly this is all
the more so because the subject in question &mdash;programming for
automatic calculators&mdash; did not even exist when I was as old as you
are. What am I piffling about transferring the ancestral inheritance?
Where did that parvenu get the idea? </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Well, that's very simple. Of
course, my ancestry has not thought about programming for automatic
calculators, because it was not yet confronted with those things.
What our ancestry has done is to build a tradition of effectively using
your brains and clearly identifying the function of abstraction as
intellectual action: the introduction of abstractions is the opposite
of introducing ambiguities, it is introducing a new semantic level,
on which one can express himself again very precisely. It is my task
to try to convince you that in this new area too, mastering the
ancient, proven techniques of thinking are a prerequisite for the
production of work of sufficient quality. I give these lectures
because I'm more convinced of that necessity than most of the
mathematicians who have not yet devoted themselves much to automatic
calculators, more convinced than the majority of computer scientists,
who have not yet discovered that they should practice their
profession as mathematician. I give this lecture, supported by my
credo, that programming is one of the most difficult branches of applied
mathematics, because it is also one of the most difficult engineering
subjects, and vice versa. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">That subjects may be very difficult
intrinsically does not fit into the ideology of Dr. van Kemenade and
preferably he would abolish them in the context of the general
education dilution. I consider it my duty to resist  this attack on
our culture and in any case as long as this nobody is Minister of
Education and Science, I consider it irresponsible to leave my chair.
Poison should be contested with antidote. Now you know, why I give
lectures: why you listen you must find out for yourself in the course
of the semester. </FONT>
