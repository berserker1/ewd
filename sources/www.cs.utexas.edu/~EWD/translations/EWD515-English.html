<P>A more or less mechanical worldview has been in use at least since
classical times, when the planets were each supposed to run in its
own sphere around the earth.  In the Renaissance, the work of
Kepler, Copernicus, and Galileo, and then that of Newton, gave a new
and not be underestimated stimulus to the mechanical worldview.
Spurred by the success of science, they started to press more and
more into this straitjacket, and, e.g., in psychology there arose the school of
behaviorism, a school that uses a very mechanical human concept. And
now we&rsquo;re stuck  with it! If you look closely, the behaviorist does
not really have a human concept: they cross bred a mechanical rat
with the slobbering Pavlov dog and then said, &ldquo;Well, basically a
human functions just so.&rdquo; Only the caveat &ldquo;basically&rdquo;
seems to have worn away in the last half century; first the
individual human being, and then aggregates of them, reduce themselves
to controlling, to accounting of response versus stimulus. After
psychology, all kinds of activities have arisen in the wake of this
simplification, which quite wrongly call themselves sciences, such
as economics, sociology, pedagogy, political science,  anthropology,
and you name it: dubious activities   so aptly be
described in English as &ldquo;the soft sciences,&rdquo; with emphasis on &ldquo;soft&rdquo;
and the word &ldquo;sciences&rdquo; to be pronounced with the necessary
sarcasm in one&rsquo;s voice. Their collective name is &ldquo;Cheating&rdquo;
because they don&rsquo;t test their hypotheses &mdash;which cannot stand the
test of criticism&mdash; because of that; and their collective name is
&ldquo;Cheating&rdquo; because they are not afraid to make
recommendations without acknowledgment to have failed when the
 advice does not have the predicted effect. In fact, they do
not distinguish themselves from the rain maker, who explains the
continuing drought despite his dancing as the revenge of the gods,
nor from the fortuneteller at the fair, who distills from her crystal
ball such vague predictions that a clearly contradictory future is hardly
conceivable. But in times of trouble, when man wants more security
than what he can assert as his right, there is a queue at the fortune
teller ...

<P>Our government fortunately has understood this very well. In an
effort after World War II to make our ruined country livable again,
they stimulated higher education, which in
the thirties had gone into a dead-end, with all possible vigor. This injection, which was
intended for the sciences, unfortunately failed: It has largely
degenerated, and at universities, even the technical ones, the germ of
the &ldquo;soft sciences&rdquo; developed into a cancerous tumor. And
the endless drivel made its entrance. What does one do with a major
failure? Quite simply: One does not even bother to deny it, one
explains it ex cathedra as a success, as a promising step toward a
better society! 
</P>
<P>Of course it is annoying that in the older scientific disciplines
there are still bourgeois scholars, who can separate the wheat from
the chaff; no problem: You tighten their financial thumbscrews  and they will face up to reality. This technique is known since
the Inquisition. If nevertheless the saving message of the &ldquo;soft
sciences&rdquo; by blatant quackery still sounds a bit unconvincing,
again, do not worry! It is explained as the proof that in recent
decades insufficient funds were made available for the &ldquo;soft
sciences&rdquo; and therefore justifies the decision to withhold funds
from science to be transferred to the quack. To cover these rogue
maneuvers, one invents a Minister of Science Policy. To politically
underline the fact that the established sciences actually are not so
important, they choose a failed student for the position. For further
details, I refer you to the notes of Minister Trip and to the latest
Queen&rsquo;s Speech. 
</P>
<P>Postponing further consequences of the emerging quackery until
next time, we proceed with today&rsquo;s orders.
