  <h1>Two theorems on (what I have called) continuously mixed sequences</h1>
  <div class='body'>
						<p>A sequence of characters from a finite alphabet is called &quot;continuously mixed&quot; if and only if for any position in the sequence each character from the alphabet occurs both somewhere on its left and somewhere on its right. As a result continuously mixed sequences extend infinitely, both to the left and to the right, and each character from the finite alphabet occurs infinitely often in such a continuously mixed sequence.</p>
						<u>Lemma 1</u>. A continuously mixed sequence from an <i>N</i>-character alphabet such that between any two successive occurrences of one character each other character occurs exactly only once, has a period of length <i>N.</i> (End of Lemma 1.)
						<p><u>Proof</u>. The periodicity follows immediately from the observation that two successive occurrences of the same character are <i>N</i> positions apart. (End of Proof.)</p>
						<p></p>
						<u>Lemma 2</u>. For continuously mixed sequences from a two-character alphabet we have</div>
					<div align="center">
						<p>P0 <u>or</u> (P1 <u>and</u> P2)</p>
					</div>
					<div align="left">

								<td align="left" valign="top">P0:</td>

								<td align="left" valign="top">P2:</td>
								<td align="left" valign="top">there exist successive occurrences of one character with more than one occurrence of the other character in between. (End of Lemma 2.)</td>

						</table>
						<p><u>Proof</u>. Lemma 2 follows from the observations <u>non</u> P0 = P1 and <u>non</u> P0 = P2 . (If the characters occur alternatingly, i.e. P0 holds, then neither P1 nor P2 holds; if the characters don't occur alternatingly, i.e. P0 doesn't hold, both P1 and P2 hold.) The equivalence P1 = P2 represents the surprise content of Lemma 2. (End of Proof.)</p>
						<p>These two lemmata lead to</p>
						<p><u>Theorem 1</u>. A continuously mixed sequence from an <i>N</i>-character alphabet such that all successive occurrences of one character have at least one occurrence of each other character in between, has a period of length <i>N</i> . (End of Theorem 1.)</p>
						<p><u>Theorem 2</u>. A continuously mixed sequence from an <i>N</i>-character alphabet such that all successive occurrences of one character have at most one occurrence of each other character in between, has a period of length <i>N</i> . (End of Theorem 2.)</p>
						<p>Proof. We focus our attention on an arbitrary pair of characters by removing all occurrences of all other characters. For the resulting continuously mixed sequence from a two-character alphabet, the antecedent of Theorem 1 is -- because its &quot;at least one&quot; is the negation of &quot;less than one&quot; -- equivalent to <u>non</u> P1 , and the antecedent of Theorem 2 is -- because its &quot;at most one&quot; is the negation of &quot;more than one&quot; -- equivalent to <u>non</u> P2 . In both cases, Lemma 2 establishes for the resulting continuously mixed sequences the truth of P0 . Because this conclusion holds for any pair of characters, the antecedent of Lemma 1 is satisfied, and its consequent proves the two theorems. (End of Proof.)</p>

						<p>The two theorema seem neither very deep nor very important. Since I discovered them last Friday, I have shown them to quite a few mathematicians -- you can do so without pencil and paper, over a cup of coffee -- and each time the theorems evoked surprise, and the proofs evoked amusement. I have not fathomed yet why, but in any case their reactions showed quite clearly that the above is &quot;neat&quot; enough to deserve being recorded.</p>
