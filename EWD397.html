<b>Self-stabilizing systems with distributed control.</b>
<p>We consider a connected graph in which the majority of the possible edges
are missing and with a finite state machine placed at each node; machines placed
in directly connected nodes are called each other&rsquo;s &ldquo;neighbours&rdquo;. For each
machine one or more so-called &ldquo;privileges&rdquo; are defined, i.e. boolean functions
of its own state and the states of its neighbours; when such a boolean function
is true, we say that the privilege is &ldquo;present&rdquo;. If a privilege is present, it
can be &ldquo;selected&rdquo; and the corresponding &ldquo;move&rdquo; is then made, i.e. the machine
enjoying the selected privilege is brought into a new state that is a function
of its old state and the states of its neighbours; if for such a machine more
than one privilege has been defined, that function may also depend on the
privilege selected.
<p>Furthermore there is a global criterion, telling whether the system as
a whole is in a &ldquo;legitimate&rdquo; state. We require that
<br>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in each legitimate state one or more privileges will be present, and
<br>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in each legitimate state each possible move will bring the system again
in a legitimate state, and
<br>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;each privilege must be present in at least one legitimate state, and
<br>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for any pair of legitimate states there exists a sequence of moves
transferring the system from the one into the other.
<p>We call the system self-stabilizing if and only if regardless of the
initial state and regardless of the privilege selected for the next move,
always at least one privilege will be present and the system is guaranteed
to find itself in a legitimate state after a finite number of moves. For a
long time it has been an open question whether non-trivial (e.g. all states
legitimate is considered trivial) self-stabilizing systems could exist. It is
not directly obvious whether the local moves can assure convergence towards
satisfaction of such a global criterion; the non-determinacy of the privilege
selected is an added complication. The question is settled by each of the
following three constructs. For brevity&rsquo;s sake the heuristics that lead me
to find them the proofs that they satisfy the requirements have been omitted
and &mdash;to quote Douglas T.Ross&rsquo;s comment on an earlier draft&mdash; &ldquo;the appreciation
is left as an exercise for the reader&rdquo;.
<p>In all three solutions I consider N+1 machines, numbered from 0 through N.
In order to avoid avoidable subscripts I shall use for machine nr.i:
<table><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
L:</td><td>to refer to the state of its lefthand neighbour, machine nr.(i-1)<b>mod</b>(N+1),
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>
S:</td><td>to refer to the state of itself, machine nr.i,
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>
R:</td><td>to refer to the state of its righthand neighbour, machine nr.(i+1)<b>mod</b>(N+1).
</td>  </tr>  </table>
In other words, we confine ourselves to machines placed in a ring; machine
nr.0 will also be called &ldquo;the bottom machine&rdquo;, machine nr.N will also be called
&ldquo;the top machine&rdquo;. For the legitimate states we have chosen those states in
which exactly one privilege is present. In describing the designs we shall use
the format: &ldquo;<b>if</b> privilege <b>then</b> corresponding move <b>fi</b>&rdquo;
<p class="noindent"><b>Solution with K-state machines (K &ge; N).</b>
<p>Here each machine state is represented by an integer value S, satisfying
0 &lt; S &lt; K. For each machine, one privilege is defined, viz.
<br>for the bottom machine: <b>if</b> L = S <b>then</b> S:= (S + 1)<b>mod</b> K <b>fi</b>
<br>for the other machines: <b>if</b> L &ne; S <b>then</b> S:= L <b>fi</b> .
<p class="noindent"><b>Solution with four-state machines.</b>
<p>Here each machine state is represented by two booleans xS and upS. For
the bottom machine upS = <b>true</b> by definition, for the top machine upS = <b>false</b>
by definition: these two machines are therefore only two-state machines.
The privileges are defined as follows:
<br>for the bottom machine: <b>if</b> xS = xR <b>and</b> <b>non</b> upR <b>then</b> xS:= <b>non</b> xS <b>fi</b>
<br>for the top machine: <b>if</b> xS &ne; xL <b>then</b> xS:= <b>non</b> XS <b>fi</b>
<br>for the other machines: <b>if</b> xS &ne; xL <b>then</b> xS:= <b>non</b> xS; upS:= <b>true</b> <b>fi</b>;
                        <b>if</b> xS = xR <b>and</b> upS <b>and</b> <b>non</b> upR <b>then</b> upS:= <b>false</b> <b>fi</b> .
<p>The four-state machines may enjoy two privileges. The neighbour relation
between bottom and top machine is not exploited; we may merge them into a single
machine which is then also a four-state machine for which also two privileges
have been defined.
<p class="noindent"><b>Solution with three-state machines.</b>
Here each machine state is represented by an integer value S, satisfying
0 &le; S &lt;3. The privileges are defined as follows:
<table>
<tr><td valign=top width=30%> for the bottom machine: </td></td><td valign=top width=80%>
<b>if</b> (S + 1)<b>mod</b> 3 = R <b>then</b> S:= (S - 1)<b>mod</b> 3 <b>fi</b></td><td>
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top> for the top machine: </td></td><td valign=top>
<b>if</b> L = R <b>and</b> (L + 1)<b>mod</b> 3 &ne; S <b>then</b> S:= (L + 1)<b>mod</b> 3 <b>fi</b></td><td>
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top> for the other machines: </td></td><td valign=top>
<b>if</b> (S + 1)<b>mod</b> 3 = L <b>then</b> S:= L <b>fi</b>;</td><td>
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>  </td></td><td valign=top>
<b>if</b> (S+1)<b>mod</b> 3 = R <b>then</b> S:= R <b>fi</b></td><td>.
</td>  </tr>  </table>
<p>Again the machines nr.i with 0 &lt; i &lt; N may enjoy two privileges, the
neighbour relation between bottom and top machine has been exploited.
<p class="noindent">Acknowledgements are due to C.S.Scholten who unmasked an earlier effort as
fallacious and since then has found a nice proof for solutions of the first
type and to M.Woodger whose fascination by the first two solutions was an
incentive to find the third.
