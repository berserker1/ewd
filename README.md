Present the classic writings of Edsger W. Dijkstra in a more modern way.

The [E.W. Dijkstra Archive](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/) have done a
tremendous job of archiving and transcribing Dijkstra's writings. These
documents are a joy and an inspiration to read, but presented there in a
rather old-fashioned way.

This project is an attempt to present this amazing content more pleasantly.
