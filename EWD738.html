ingenious, but has the disadvantage that it is often extremely difficult

<p>The purpose of this debunking note is to expose a few time-honoured
mathematical concepts as mere artefacts of an unfortunate notation. The
unfortunate notation writes <b>non</b> A &ge; C or <b>non</b> C &rArr; A instead of the
symmetric disjunction A <b>or</b> C .
<p class="noindent"><b>The indirect proof</b>.
<p>Mathematicians call a proof of the theorem A &rArr; B "indirect" when,
instead of proving A &ge; B "directly", one proves <b>non</b> B &rArr; <b>non</b> A . But
you cannot prove the one without proving the other: both are equivalent to
<b>non</b> A <b>or</b> B . The distinction is void.
<p class="noindent"><b>The reductio ad absurdum.</b> 
<p>With C <b>and non</b> C as the prototype of a contradiction &mdash;an "absurdity"&mdash;
the reductio ad absurdum proceeds as follows. In order to prove A
<table>
<tr><td>0)</td><td>one proves </td><td><b>non</b> A &rArr; C</td></tr>
<tr><td>1) </td><td>one proves </td><td><b>non</b> A &rArr; <b>non</b> C</td></tr>
<tr><td>2) </td><td>one concludes </td><td><b>non</b> A &rArr; (C <b>and non</b> C) , hence A .</td></tr>
</table>
<p>But, apart from notation, the above proof must be equivalent to
<table>
<tr><td>0) </td><td>proving </td><td><b>non</b> C &rArr; A</td></tr>
<tr><td>1) </td><td>proving </td><td>C &rArr; A</td></tr>
<tr><td>2) </td><td>concluding </td><td>(C <b>or</b> <b>non</b> C) &rArr; A , hence A .</td></tr>
</table>
In so-called contrast to the first proof the latter one is called "a proof by
case analysis"! The distinction is void. I prefer
<table>
<tr><td>0) </td><td>proving </td><td>A <b>or</b> C </td></tr>
<tr><td>1) </td><td>proving </td><td>A <b>or</b> <b>non</b> C </td></tr>
<tr><td>2) </td><td>concluding</td><td>A </td></tr>
</table>
                         
<p class="noindent"><b>Mathematical induction</b>.
<p>I was taught two patterns for mathematical induction.
<br>Pattern 1:
<table>
<tr><td>1.0) </td><td> prove P(0)</td><td> ("the base")  </td></tr>
<tr><td>1.1) </td><td> prove (<u>A</u> n: n &ge; 0: P(n) &rArr; P(n+1)) </td><td>("the induction step)</td></tr>
<tr><td>1.2) </td><td> conclude (<u>A</u> n: n &ge; 0 P(n)) </td><td>  </td></tr>
</table>
Pattern 2:
<table>
<tr><td>2.1) </td><td> prove (<u>A</u> n: n &ge; 0 (A i: 0 &le; i &lt; n: P(i)) &rArr; P(n)) </td></tr>
<tr><td>2.2) </td><td>conclude (<u>A</u> n: n &ge; 0: P(n))     </td></tr>
</table>
<p>The following are comments on the way in which I was introduced to them&mdash;
a way that, I am afraid, is rather standard.
<p>Pattern 1 , which regretfully is the better known one, was postulated
and by renaming, substitution, and simplification pattern 2 was derived from
it.
<p>My first complaint is that no one pointed out to me that the two are
<b>equivalent</b>, i.e. that by suitable renaming, substitution, and simplification
the validity of pattern 1 can again be derived from the postulated validity
of pattern 2.
<p>My second complaint is that no one ever pointed out to me that the
transition from pattern 1 to pattern 2 represents an obviously permissible
strengthening of the induction hypothesis, thereby offering the opportunity
for a simpler proof obligation.
<p>My third complaint is that no one pointed out to me that for given P
pattern 2 is in a sense canonical because the transition from 1 to 2 is
idempotent. The moral of the story is that pattern 2 should always be
preferred.
<p>Fermat's "infinite descent" consists of proving (<u>A</u> n: n &ge; 0: P(n))
by showing that the assumption <b>non</b> P(n) leads to the existence of a natural
value i &lt; n , such that <b>non</b> P(i) , which then leads to a contradiction.
<p>I quote from E.T.Bell again &mdash;but this time from his "Men of Mathematics"&mdash;
                      
"His own account is both concise and clear, so we shall give a free translation
from his letter of August, 1659, to Carcavi.
<p>"For a long time I was unable to apply my method to affirmative propositions,
because the twist and the trick for getting at them is much more
troublesome than that which I use for negative propositions. Thus, when I
had to prove that every prime which exceeds a multiple of 4 by 1 is composed
of two squares, I found myself in a fine torment. But at last a meditation
repeated many times gave me the light I lacked, and now affirmative propositions
submit to my method. The course of my reasoning in affirmative propositions
is such: if an arbitrarily chosen prime of the form 4n+1 is not a
sum of two squares, [I prove that] there will be another of the same nature,
less than the one chosen, and [therefore] next a third still less, and so on.
Making an infinite descent of all the numbers of this kind I arrive at the number
5, the least of all the numbers of this kind [4n+1]. [By the proof mentioned
and the preceding argument from it], it follows that 5 is not a sum
of two squares. But it is. Therefore we must infer by a reductio ad absurdum
that all primes of the form 4n+1 are sums of two squares." "
<p>But what is Fermat's proof obligation? With
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
</td><td>P(n): the n-th prime of the form 4k+1 is the sum of two squares
</td>  </tr>  </table>
he has to prove
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
</td><td>(<u>A</u> n: n &ge; 0 : <b>non</b> P(n) &rArr; (<u>E</u> i: 0 &le; i &lt; n: <b>non</b> P(i))),
</td>  </tr>  </table>
but this is <b>identical</b> to 2.1: both are
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
</td><td>(<u>A</u> n: n &ge; 0: (<u>E</u> i: 0 &le; i &lt; n: <b>non</b> P(i)) <b>or</b> P(n)).
</td>  </tr>  </table>
Hence Fermat's method of "infinite descent" is nothing but normal mathematical
induction in its easiest form. It doesn't deserve a special name and E.T.Bell's
appreciation of it as quoted at the beginning of this text is all rubbish.
