  <p class=noindent><b>An answer to Jack Mazola.</b>
<p>Thank you for your letter of 7 Nov. 1975. I was very pleased to read
that my writings had inspired John McClintock and you to do better than
your (or McElintock&rsquo;s) first effort. I had &mdash;and I offer my apologies if
this is a great disappointment&mdash; difficulties in understanding your invariants,
because they are mixed expressions in two different languages: on the 
left-hand side of the implication we have boolean expression which at any moment
in time are defined by the current state of the aggregate, at the right-hand
side of the implication are phrases about past and future, and not all 
sentences &mdash;such as &ldquo;if he ever restarts&rdquo;&mdash; were too clear to me. The only thing
left for me to do was to try to convince myself that everything was OK in
my own (old-fashioned! see below) way. The following is not a description
of how I would develop the program ab initio: I cannot fake that, I have
been &ldquo;spoiled&rdquo; by studying your solution and, as a result, have lost my
virginity. The first thing I did was to study the following program (here
&ldquo;x&rdquo; is a local variable of each machine)
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td colspan = 3>
      <b>do</b> <b>non</b> initialized &rarr;                    </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td colspan = 2>
            done[me]:= false;                                    </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td colspan = 2>
            x:= 1; <b>do</b> done[x] &rarr; x:= x + 1 <b>od</b>; </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td colspan = 2>
            <b>if</b> x = me &rarr; initialized:= true           </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td>&nbsp; </td> <td>
             &#x25af; x &lt; me &rarr; skip                      </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td colspan = 2>
            <b>fi</b>;                                           </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td colspan = 2>
            done[me]:= true                                      </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td colspan = 3>
      <b>od</b>                                                  </td> </tr>
</table>
and asked myself the question whether &ldquo;initialized&rdquo; will become true, when
a number of the machines is started. The answer is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, provided the
machines that re not started have their done = true; the argument is that
of the started machines the one with the lowest number is certain to end
its inner loop with x = me and will therefore perform &ldquo;initialize:= true&rdquo;.
Note that for this argument the initial value of done for the machines that
are started, is irrelevant.
<p>The next question is: can we make of &ldquo;initialize:= true&rdquo; mutually
exclusive actions &mdash;so-called &ldquo;critical sections&rdquo;. So I tried to do it by
inserting your waiter (note that in your letter, page 4, is a misprint, it
should be
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td colspan = 5>
      &ldquo;<b>do</b> X &le; HI &rarr; <b>do</b> <b>non</b> DONE[X] &rarr; SKIP <b>od</b>&rdsquo; ) </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td colspan = 4>&nbsp;

            <b>fi</b>;                                                                              </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td colspan = 3>
            done[me]:= true                                                                         </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td colspan = 5>
      <b>od</b>                                                                                     </td> </tr>
</table>
Assume that at moment t machines i and j (i &ne; j) are both
ready to perform &ldquo;initialized:= true&rdquo;. Then we have at moment t:
done[i] = done[j] = false.
Let ti be the last moment &lt; t such that done[i] was true;
let tj be the last moment &lt; t such that done[j] was true.
From the fact that machine i has reached the statement &ldquo;initialized:= true&rdquo;
we can conclude that done[j] = true has been observed while done[i] was
already = false , hence ti &lt; tj . Similarly we find that tj &lt; ti , and
this gives us the required contradiction. Mutual exclusion is guaranteed.
The next question is: can we have introduced deadlock by our addition?
We cannot have a number of processes mutually blocking each other with their
done = false in that added waiting cycle, because the one with the largest
number of the set does not inspect the other values done from the set. But
machine i may be kept in that inner cycle by a machine j (j &gt; i) happily
rotating in the outer cycle, but with such a speed that machine i always
misses the rare moments that done[j] = true . Therefore the assignment
done[me]: true is followed by
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td colspan = 2>
      x:= 1;                                                                         </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td colspan = 2>
      <b>do</b> x &lt; me &rarr; <b>do</b> <b>non</b> done[x] &rarr; skip <b>od</b>; </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
            x:= x + 1                                                                </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td colspan = 2>
      <b>od</b>                                                                      </td> </tr>
</table>
Because of the arguments given by you this does not introduce the danger
of deadlock in the last waiting cycle.
The last modification is to ensure that initialization now occurs
only once; because &ldquo;initialized:= true&rdquo; has been guaranteed to be executed
in a critical section, it suffices obviously to replace it by
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%>  </td><td valign=top>
<b>do</b> <b>non</b> initialized &rarr; initialize; initialized:= true <b>od</b></td><td align=right>(1)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
and now I have arrived at a program that differs only marginally from your
solution, which I thought a very beautiful one.
<p align="center" class="noindent">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>*</p> 
<p>There is a second way in which I am no virgin with respect to this
problem: it is very similar to the critical section problem that I solved
in the Sep.1965 issue of the Comm.ACM., and naturally, the old patterns of
reasoning come again floating in my consciousness. To prove things about
such processes that may interfere with each other in such a fine-grained
fashion is a risky business, as I have learned the hard way.(In the meantime
you should have received EWD520, our next, and hopefully last, version of
the on-the-fly garbage collection.) The person with the most extensive
experience of proving things about such aggregates of programs is David
Gries. One of the more valuable tricks is to associate &ldquo;ghost variables&rdquo;
to which the programs only assign values. They &mdash;i.e. their values&mdash; can
then be used to express things about the progress of the various programs,
they provide means for expressing formally and without ambiguity such things
as mutual exclusion. In this example, mutual exclusion is clearly needed
if a precaution like (1) is to ensure that initialization will only be
performed <b>once</b>. But even then, to formalize the ti &lt; tj and tj &lt; ti
argument of the previous page is no fun; as yet I have seen no more formal,
yet &ldquo;decent&rdquo; argument. (A challenge when I have nothing else to do!) For
practical reasons I would regard the argument on the previous page convincing
enough. As yet the formal proofs tend to become hairy....
<p align="center" class="noindent">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>*</p> 
<p>Finally I would like to congratulate you with your decision not to be
content with the first solution and it justification. The experience that
the next effort gives something much nicer is a very common one, but it is
only believed by those who have had the experience themselves!
<center>Yours ever,</center>
