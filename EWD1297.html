				<p>In this note, &ldquo;fractions&rdquo; are restricted to quotients of positive integers. If a/b and c/d are two such fractions of different values, one is asked to construct a third fraction that lies between them.</p>
				<p>The book in which we met this problem &mdash;a textbook of Anuj Misra&rsquo;s&mdash; started by giving the fractions equal denominators, so 2/3 and 3/4 would become 8/12 and 9/12, but then the problem is that there is no integer between 8 and 9; this is overcome by introducing an extra factor of 2, so that the fractions become 16/24 and 18/24 and the answer 17/24. When, later, I started to discuss this problem with an American colleague, he came up with the same solution, which made me wonder whether I had met a cultural difference between two continents because, spontaneously and indepedently, Ria and I had reacted with &ldquo;What about (<var>a</var>+<var>c</var>)/(<var>b</var>+<var>d</var>)?&rdquo; The reasons for writing this little note, however, are my experiences in proving the correctness of the this hunch.</p>
				<p>I first came up with a visual proof, and later with a calculational one. In both proofs we restrict ourselves to</p>
				<p class="noindent">(0)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<var>a</var>&#x200A;/<var>b</var> &lt; <var>c</var>&#x200A;/<var>d</var></p>
				<p class="noindent"><u>The visual proof</u></p>
				<p>Connect the points (<var>b</var>,&thinsp;<var>a</var>) and (<var>d</var>,&thinsp;<var>c</var>) to the origin and complete the parallelogram				</p>
				<p><img src="EWD1297.fig.png" width="432" height="177" alt="figure" /></p>
			  <p>Because of the monotonicity of the tangent in the 1st quadrant and the fact the diagonal of a parallelogram lies inside that parallelogram, i.e., between the two sides, we conclude</p>
				<p class="noindent">(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<var>a</var>&#x200A;/<var>b</var> &lt; (<var>a</var>+<var>c</var>)/(<var>b</var>+<var>d</var>) &lt; <var>c</var>/<var>d</var></p>
				<p class="noindent"><u>The calculational proof</u></p>
				<p> For the left inequality of (1) we observe</p>
				<p> <var>a</var>&#x200A;/<var>b</var> &lt; (<var>a</var>+<var>c</var>&#x200A;)/(<var>b</var>+<var>d</var>&#x200A;)</p>
				<p class="continue">&#x2261;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x200A;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<var> b</var>&#x200A;&#x00B7;&#x200A;(<var>b</var>+<var>d</var>&#x200A;)&thinsp;&gt;&thinsp;0 }</p>
				<p class="nospace"> <var>a</var><span class="continue">&#x200A;&#x00B7;&#x200A;</span>(<var>b</var>+<var>d</var>&#x200A;) &lt; (<var>a</var>+<var>c</var>&#x200A;)<span class="continue">&#x200A;&#x00B7;&#x200A;</span><var>b</var></p>
				<p class="continue">&#x2261;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{ algebra }</p>
				<p class="nospace"> <var>a</var><span class="continue">&#x200A;&#x00B7;&#x200A;</span><var>d</var> &lt; <var>c</var><span class="continue">&#x200A;&#x00B7;&#x200A;</span><var>b</var></p>
				<p class="continue"><span class="noindent">&#x2261;</span><span class="noindent">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>{<var> b</var>&#x200A;&#x00B7;&#x200A;<var>d</var> &gt; 0 }</p>
				<p class="nospace"> <var>a</var>&#x200A;/<var>b</var> &lt; <var>c</var>&#x200A;/<var>d</var></p>
				<p>A similar proof shows that also the right inequality of (1) is equivalent to (0), to which we could restrict ourselves &ldquo;without loss of generality&rdquo;.</p>
				<p class="center"> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br />
				  *</p>
				<p>It was a few days after the problem had been shown to us when I realized that I had not taken the trouble to prove the correctness of our hunch; after a while, the visual proof came to the mind, and I must confess that it convinced me.</p>
				<p>It was another few days later when my mind returned to the visual &ldquo;proof&rdquo; and I realized how shaky it was and how much it had left unsaid. It draws &ldquo;conclusions&rdquo; from the loosely stated fact that the diagonals lie &ldquo;inside&rdquo; the parallelogram, but how to prove that? In all probability by proving (1)! By not being explicit about the rules of the game and appealing to &ldquo;the visual intuition&rdquo; instead, one introduces a lot of ambiguity about the whole enterprise of proving. No wonder that the kids at school get confused!</p>
				<p>After all the above I began to wonder what went into the construction of the hunch: certainly neither of the two arguments shown above. I was at least familiar with the following ingredients:</p>
				<p class="continue">(i) fractions are monotonic functions of their numerators and antimonotonic functions of their denominators,</p>
			  <p class="continue">(ii) the whole problem is in a sense insensitive to a systematic replacement of <var>a</var>&#x200A;/<var>b</var> by <var>b</var>/a, etc.,</p>
				<p class="continue">(iii) the problem is symmetric in the two given fractions &mdash;the word &ldquo;between&rdquo; makes it that&mdash;, </p>
				<p class="continue">(iv) the sum is the first symmetric, monotonic function of integers that comes to my mind.</p>
				<p> That probably suffices.</p>
