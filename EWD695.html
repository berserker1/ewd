<h1>Mathematics in an easy chair.</h1>
<div class='body'>

		<p>This afternoon W.H.J.Feijen posed me the following problem.  Take a
		circular piece of string -- of length <samp>1</samp>, say -- and select three times a random
		point of the string.  Ignoring the case of coincident points -- which has a
		probability <samp>= 0</samp> -- we get three pieces of string when we cut the string at
		the tree points chosen.  How large is the probability that, stretched, these
		three pieces could form a triangle, or, more precisely, if the lengths are
		called <samp>x</samp>, <samp>y</samp>, and <samp>z</samp> respectively, how large is the probability that the
		three inequalities <samp>x &le; y + z</samp>, <samp>y &le; z + x</samp>, and <samp>z &le; x + y</samp> are satisfied?
		Could I think of a simple argument that would not destroy the symmetry of the
		problem statement?</p>

		<p>I thought about the problem in an easy chair in the living room, while
		enjoying a glass of sherry before dinner.  The answer is <samp>1/4</samp>, and here is
		my argument.</p>

		<p>To every choice of three points we can assign uniquely three values
		<samp>x</samp>, <samp>y</samp> and <samp>z</samp> : we take them, for instance, in the clockwise direction,
		starting with the first point chosen.  Hence, for any value of <samp>z</samp>, the value
		<samp>x</samp> is drawn homogeneously from <samp>0</samp> to <samp>1 - z</samp> .  For any set of values we
		can plot in a three-dimensional space with three rectangular coordinates the
		point <samp>(x, y, z)</samp>;  all these points lie in the plane with equation <samp>x + y + z = 1</samp>,
		more precisely within the equilateral triangle with vertices <samp>(1,0,0)</samp>, <samp>(0,1,0)</samp>,
		and <samp>(0,0,1)</samp> respectively.  Because for fixed <samp>z</samp> --see above-- <samp>x</samp> is drawn
		homogeneously from <samp>0</samp> to <samp>1 - z</samp> , the probability density is in this triangle
		constant along a line parallel to its side in the <samp>(x,y)-plane</samp>.  For reasons
		of symmetry the probability density is constant along a line parallel to any
		of its three sides, and, hence, the probability density is constant over the
		whole triangle.  The required probability is therefore the area of the triangle
		satisfying the three inequalities divided by the area of the whole triangle.
		As the plane <samp>x = y + z</samp> cuts the triangle in the midpoints of two of its sides
		--viz. <samp>(.5,.5,0)</samp> and <samp>(.5,0,.5)</samp>-- and the interior of the little triangle
		corresponds to the points satisfying the triangular inequalities, the
		probability sought equals <samp>1/4</samp>.

        <p>The above should not be interpreted as a recommendation for drinking
        a glass of sherry before dinner.  The circumstances under which I found the
        above solution have, however been recorded as they form the <samp>N-th</samp> confirmation
        <samp>(N large)</samp> of the experience that postponing the use of pencil and paper
        is very helpful in finding a simple solution (if there is one, of course).  If
        I had a Thinking School, my students would have their hands tied behind their
        back!</p>
        
        <p>Finding the above solution took about ten minutes</p>
