<b>The equivalence of bounded nondeterminacy and continuity</b>.
<p>Unbounded nondeterminacy is presented by the function &ldquo;any natural
number&rdquo; such that
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
</td><td>wp("x:= any natural number", 0 &le; x) = T
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>
</td><td>wp("x:= any natural number", x &le; k) = F    for <b>all</b>  k .
</td>  </tr>  </table>

Program S is continuous &mdash;see Chapter 9 of &ldquo;A Discipline of 
Programming&rdquo;, where this property is called Property 5&mdash; means that for any
infinite sequence of predicates C<sub>0</sub> , C<sub>1</sub> , C<sub>2</sub> , ... such that
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
</td><td>for r &ge; 0 &nbsp; &nbsp; C<sub>r</sub> &ne; C<sub>r+1</sub>  &nbsp; &nbsp; for all states
</td>  </tr>  </table>
we have for all states
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%>  </td><td valign=top>
wp(S, (<u>E</u> r: r &ge; 0: c<sub>r</sub>)) = (<u>E</u> s: s &ge; 0: wp(S, c<sub>s</sub>))</td><td align=right>(1)
</td>  </tr>  </table>

and in the same chapter I have shown that all programs that could be
written in my programming language fragment &mdash;with finite (1) guarded
command sets&mdash; are continuous.
<p>It is further shown that the program &ldquo;x:= any natural number&rdquo; is
not continuous &mdash;and, hence, cannot be written in that programming language
fragment&mdash; . For the sake of completeness, we repeat the proof. Assume
the program S: &ldquo;x2: any natural number&rdquo; to be continuous. We then have:
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td colspan = 2>
        T = wp(S, 0 &le; x)                                </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
          = wp(S, (<u>E</u> r: r &ge; 0: 0 &le;x &le; r))  </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td>
          = (<u>E</u> s: s &ge; 0: wp(S, 0 &le; x &le; s)) </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td>
          = (<u>E</u> s: s &ge; 0: F) = F                  </td> </tr>
</table>

a contradiction that leads to the conclusion that &ldquo;x:= any natural number&rdquo;
cannot be continuous, i.e. that continuity implies bounded nondeterminacy.
<p>In the sequel of this note we shall show that the inverse holds as well,
viz. that the existence of a noncontinuous program implies the inclusion of
unbounded nondeterminacy. (The following argument was suggested to me by
C.S.Scholten almost instantaneously when I had posed the problem.)
Assume the existence of a program S and an infinite sequence of
                         
predicates C such that C<sub>r</sub> &rArr; C<sub>r+1</sub>, such that (1) does not hold. Because
in (1) the right-hand side implies the left-hand side trivially, this means
that we assume
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
</td><td>wp(S, (<u>E</u> r: r &ge; 0: c<sub>r</sub>))<b>and</b> <b>non</b> (E s: s &ge; 0: wp(S, c<sub>s</sub>)) =                   
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>  </td><td valign=top>
wp(S, (<u>E</u> r: r &ge; 0: c<sub>r</sub>))<b>and</b> (<u>A</u> s: s &ge; 0: <b>non</b> wp(S, c<sub>s</sub>))</td><td align=right>(2)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
to be different from F .
<p>Consider now the program
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
       S; x:= (<b>MIN</b>: k: C<sub>k</sub>) </td> </tr>
</table>
started in an initial state satisfying (2). Because the initial state
satisfies wp(S, (<u>E</u> r: r &ge; 0: C<sub>r</sub>)) , this program terminates and is
guaranteed to establish 0 &le; x . On the other hand, the assumption that
for some K it is certain to establish x &le; K means that S is certain
to establish C<sub>K</sub> , a conclusion that is incompatible with the second term
of (2). Hence its nondeterminacy is unbounded. (The fact that our program
of unbounded nondeterminacy is not a total program, but only defined for
initial states satisfying (2) is here not relevant: the essential thing is
that (2) differs from F , i.e. that the set of states satisfying (2) is
not empty.)
<p>Here we have established the <b>equivalence</b> of continuity and the 
boundedness of nondeterminacy. In EWD673 we have established the equivalence between
the boundedness of nondeterminacy and the equality between weak and strong
termination. Hence the three criteria
<br>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;continuity or not
<br>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nondeterminacy bounded or not
<br>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;weak and strong termination equivalent or not
are three different aspects of the <b>same</b> dichotomy. All this is very
satisfying. (The arguments are so simple that, presumable, this is already
known. But it was new for me, and I like the arguments.)
