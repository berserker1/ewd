and in the same chapter I have shown that all programs that could be written in my programming language fragment —with finite (1) guarded command sets— are continuous.
<p>It is further shown that the program “x:= any natural number” is not continuous —and, hence, cannot be written in that programming language fragment— . For the sake of completeness, we repeat the proof. Assume the program S: “x2: any natural number” to be continuous. We then have:</p>

a contradiction that leads to the conclusion that “x:= any natural number” cannot be continuous, i.e. that continuity implies bounded nondeterminacy.
<p>In the sequel of this note we shall show that the inverse holds as well, viz. that the existence of a noncontinuous program implies the inclusion of unbounded nondeterminacy. (The following argument was suggested to me by C.S.Scholten almost instantaneously when I had posed the problem.) Assume the existence of a program S and an infinite sequence of predicates C such that C<sub>r</sub> ⇒ C<sub>r+1</sub>, such that (1) does not hold. Because in (1) the right-hand side implies the left-hand side trivially, this means that we assume</p>

<p>Consider now the program</p>

started in an initial state satisfying (2). Because the initial state satisfies wp(S, (<u>E</u> r: r ≥ 0: C<sub>r</sub>)) , this program terminates and is guaranteed to establish 0 ≤ x . On the other hand, the assumption that for some K it is certain to establish x ≤ K means that S is certain to establish C<sub>K</sub> , a conclusion that is incompatible with the second term of (2). Hence its nondeterminacy is unbounded. (The fact that our program of unbounded nondeterminacy is not a total program, but only defined for initial states satisfying (2) is here not relevant: the essential thing is that (2) differs from F , i.e. that the set of states satisfying (2) is not empty.)
<p>Here we have established the <b>equivalence</b> of continuity and the boundedness of nondeterminacy. In EWD673 we have established the equivalence between the boundedness of nondeterminacy and the equality between weak and strong termination. Hence the three criteria<br>
1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;continuity or not<br>
2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nondeterminacy bounded or not<br>
3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;weak and strong termination equivalent or not are three different aspects of the <b>same</b> dichotomy. All this is very satisfying. (The arguments are so simple that, presumable, this is already known. But it was new for me, and I like the arguments.)</p>
