  <h1>Philips and I: a few snapshots</h1>
  <div class='body'>
<p> I was working at the Mathematical Centre in Amsterdam when I was introduced to the people who built computers at Philips Research Laboratories in Eindhoven. It was a type of people I did not know, I found them very strange and they did not inspire confidence at all. Later I learned that I had been introduced to electronic engineers. </p>
<p> In Eindhoven they built the &quot;Peter&quot; and the &quot;Pascal&quot;, and then Philips started its computer industry in Apeldoorn, where &#x2014;if I remember the numbers correctly&#x2014; the P1000 and the P1400 were developed in the 60s. I went to the festive inauguration of one of those machines; their demonstration was the algorithm for the shortest path, which I had used about a decade earlier for the inauguration of the ARMAC. I remember finding those guys a little lacking in originality; I was not given any credit. </p>
		<p> At the Technological University Eindhoven, where I had gone in 1962, I had to build up a group in Computing Science. By the end of the decade we had the world's leading centre  in operating system design, but Philips Apeldoorn hired none of my pupils, and a few years later Philips had to fold up its mainframe business. I remember the shock of seeing my potential domestic market being wiped out and the (difficult) conclusion that as a professor I would work for export only.</p>
		<p> While I combined the functions of Burroughs Research Fellow and of Professor Extraordinarius at the T.U. Eindhoven, I had the misfortune of inventing a possibly patentable solution under circumstances that made it totally unclear whether the patent would belong to Burroughs or to Philips. In an effort to sort out that mess, I drove with Ir. P.J.P.G. Simons to K&ouml;ln where we would meet a few relevant Burroughs officials; Ir. Simons was Adjunct Director of &quot;Octrooien &amp; Merken&quot; (= Patents &amp; Trademarks) at Philips. He was a nice, interesting and knowledgeable man, we had never met before but turned out to have a number of common acquaintenances, and an animated conversation evolved effortlessly. At a given moment he asked in a tone of some disbelief &quot;Did I understand correctly that you never lived in the United States?&quot;. I confirmed that impression, upon which he asked in utter amazement </p>
		<p> &quot;But how could you then become an expert in your area?&quot; [&quot;Maar hoe hebt U dan een expert op Uw gebied kunnen worden?&quot;] When I told this story to Ria, she immediately guessed my answer, viz. &quot;By creating the area myself.&quot;. </p>
			<p> Please remind yourself of Simons's question, each time you hear people complaining about &quot;the cultural imperialism&quot of the USA: if there is such a thing, the USA seems to be the last country to blame for it. </p>
