<b>In reaction to Ernest Chang&rsquo;s &ldquo;Deadlock Detection&rdquo;</b>.
<p>We consider a finite directed graph, without edges of which both ends
coincide, and introduce the following terminology.
Let there be an edge directed from node A to node B ; then
<br>&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this edge will be denoted as &ldquo;edge AB &rdquo;
<br>&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is an &ldquo;outgoing edge&rdquo; of node A
<br>&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is an &ldquo;incoming edge&rdquo; of node B
<br>&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;node A is a &ldquo;predecessor&rdquo; of node B
<br>&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;node B is a &ldquo;successor&rdquo; of node A .
<p>Let &ldquo;node B is reachable from node A&rdquo; mean &ldquo;node B is node A <b>or</b>
node B is a successor of a node that is reachable from node A &rdquo; .
<p>Let &ldquo;nodes A and B belong to the same strong component&rdquo; mean
&ldquo;node A is reachable from node B <b>and</b> node B is reachable from node A &rdquo;.
<p>Let a &ldquo;knot&rdquo; be a strong component of more than one node, such that
all successors of all nodes of the knot belong to the knot as well.
<p align="center" class="noindent">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>*</p> 
<p>In each node the identities of its predecessors and of its successors
are recorded; a node contains no further information about the shape of the
graph. Furthermore each node can send messages to its successors and to
its predecessors &mdash;note that, in spite of its being directed, each edge
accommodates two-way traffic&mdash; .
<p>We can now ask ourselves the question whether we can design a diffusing
computation, to be fired by an arbitrary node D , that will enable node D
to detect whether or not it belongs to a knot. Because the answer is clearly
&ldquo;No&rdquo; when node D has no successors &mdash;a circumstance that would be recorded
in node D itself&mdash; we can restrict ourselves to the case that D has at
                  
least one successor. In the latter case the statement &ldquo;node D belongs to
a knot&rdquo; is equivalent to the statement &ldquo;node D is reachable from each node
that is reachable from node D&rdquo;.
<p>From the last formulation it follows quite clearly that the determination
that node D does belong to a knot involves <b>all</b> nodes that are reachable from
node D . To establish for each node whether it is reachable from node D or
not, is the first task to which we turn our attention.
<p align="center" class="noindent">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>*</p> 
For the sake of brevity we introduce the predicate Q1, defined as
Q1(X) = &ldquo;node X is reachable from node D &rdquo; .
<p class=noindent>In order to record for each node whether Q1 has been established, we
associate with each node X a variable &mdash;of type &ldquo;natural number&rdquo;&mdash; that we
denote by Xn ; the &ldquo;significance&rdquo; of its value follows from the relation
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
P1(X):</td><td>Xn &lt; 1 <b>or</b> Q1(X) ,
</td>  </tr>  </table>
a relation that the algorithm shall keep invariant for each node X . 
Because, to start with, nothing about reachability from node D has been 
established, we assume the &mdash;in view of P1 : only safe!&mdash; initialization
Xn = 0 for each node.
<p>Nodes can send to their successors so-called M1-messages, meaning
&ldquo;the recipient of an M1 message is reachable from node D &rdquo;. We can 
justify this meaning by guarding the sending of an M1-message from node A
to node B by An &ge; 1 , because this guard implies Q1(A) on account of
P1(A) . In order to suppress (logically harmless, but superfluous) further
transmission of M1-messages along that edge, the guard is further 
strengthened by a boolean &mdash;associated with that edge and denoted by M1AB &mdash; which
is reset to false with the first transmission of an M1-message along that
edge. For each edge AB , the boolean variable M1AB is assumed to be stored
in node A and to be initialized at false.
<p>The sending of an M1-message from node A to node B can now be
                
represented by the guarded command
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td colspan = 3>
       An &ge; 1 <b>and</b> M1AB &rarr; {Ql(A) <b>and</b> Ql(B)}                                 </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td colspan = 2>
                MlAB:= false;                                                                    </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td colspan = 2>
                <b>if</b> Bn &gt; l &rarr; skip                                                  </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td>&nbsp; </td> <td>
                 &#x25af; Bn = 0 &rarr; Bn:= 1; (<u>A</u> X: X is a successor of B: MlBX:= true) </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td colspan = 2>
                <b>fi</b> {Pl(B)}                                                                </td> </tr>
</table>

The first two lines describe the sending; the following alternative construct
describes the reception .
<p>Note that &mdash;thanks to our initialization and the second alternative&mdash;
we have also the invariant
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
</td><td>An &ge; 1 <b>or</b> <b>non</b> M1AB
</td>  </tr>  </table>
for each edge AB (and that, as a result, the sending of an M1-message from
node A to node B could have been guarded by M1AB all by itself).
<p>The diffusing computation can be started by node D performing
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
</td><td>Dn:= 1; (<u>A</u> X: X is a successor of D : M1DX:= true)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
an act, which maintains all invariants. Because the graph is finite and each
edge carries at most one message, the diffusing computation will die out; from
the fact that then no more messages are sent, we conclude that in the final
state we have again non M1AB for each edge AB . Observing for the edge
AB the invariant
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
</td><td>An = 0 <b>or</b> Bn &ge; 1 <b>or</b> M1AB
</td>  </tr>  </table>
we conclude that in the final state we have for each edge AB
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
</td><td>An = 0 <b>or</b> Bn &ge; 1 .
</td>  </tr>  </table>
In the final state we can now conclude for each node X
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
</td><td>Xn &ge; 1 <b>or</b> n<b>o</b>n Q1(X)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
as follows. For a node X such that <b>non</b> Q1(X) holds it is obviously true.
For a node X such that Q1(X) holds, there exists a path from D to X ,
and our previous result tells us that on that path a node with n &ge; 1 can
only be followed on that path by a successor with n &ge; 1 as well. Hence,
                  
from Dn &ge; 1 we conclude Xn &ge; 1 , thereby establishing our latest result.
Combining our latest result with P1 we conclude that upon termination we
have for all nodes X
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
</td><td>(Xn &ge; 1) = Q1(x) .
</td>  </tr>  </table>
<p align="center" class="noindent">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>*</p> 

<p>Recalling our interest in the truth of &ldquo;node D is reachable from
each node that is reachable from node D &rdquo; and having dealt with the 
reachability from node D , we now turn our attention to the question whether
node D is reachable from a node.
<p>For the sake of brevity we introduce the predicate Q2 , defined as
Q2(X) = &ldquo;node D is reachable from node X &rdquo;
and because we are only interested in recording for nodes whether Q2 has
been established provided Q1 holds for them as well, we can use for each
node X the same variable Xn by virtue of the relation
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
P2(X):</td><td> Xn &lt; 2 <b>or</b> Q2(x) .
</td>  </tr>  </table>
a relation that the algorithm shall keep invariant for each node. In view
of our initialization Xn = 0 relation P2 holds to start with for each
node. Because our algorithm as developed so far only assigns the value 1
to Xn&rsquo;s , that earlier part of the algorithm leaves P2 invariant. We
change, however, the way in which node D starts the diffusing computation
into 
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
</td><td>Dn:= 2; (<u>A</u> X: X is a successor of D : M1DX:= true) ,
</td>  </tr>  </table>
i.e. at the start node D records that node D is reachable from itself.
<p>Nodes can send to their predecessors so-called M2-messages, meaning
&ldquo;node D is reachable from the recipient of an M2-message&rdquo;. We can justify
this meaning by guarding the sending of an M2-message from node B to its
predecessor A by Bn &ge; 2 , because that guard implies Q2(B), from which
Q2(A) follows on account of the existence of the edge AB . In order to
suppress logically harmless but superfluous transmissions of M2-messages,
the guard is further strengthened by a boolean &mdash;associated with that edge
and denoted by M2BA&mdash; which is reset to false with the first transmission
              
of an M2-message along that edge. For edge AB the boolean variable M2BA
is assumed to be stored in node B and to be initialized at false. The
boolean M2BA is also used to suppress a superfluous M2-message from node
B to a predecessor A for which Q1(A) has not (yet) been established.
Because the establishement of Q1(A) takes place in node A and M2BA is
stored in node B , we change in the transmission of an M1-message from
node A to node B the reaction of the recipient by including the setting
of M2BA.
<p>The transmission of an M1-message from node A to node B can now
be represented by the guarded command
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td colspan = 3>
      An &ge; 1 <b>and</b> MlAB &rarr;                                                            </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td colspan = 2>
               MlAB:= false;                                                                    </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td colspan = 2>
               M2BA:= true;                                                                     </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td colspan = 2>
               <b>if</b> Bn &ge; 1 &rarr; skip                                                  </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td>&nbsp; </td> <td>
                &#x25af; Bn = 0 &rarr; Bn:= 1; (<u>A</u> X: X is a successor of B: MlBX:= true) </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td colspan = 2>
               <b>fi</b>   .                                                                    </td> </tr>
</table>
The transmission of an M2-message from node B to node A can now be 
represented by the guarded command
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td colspan = 3>
      Bn &gt; 2 <b>and</b> M2BA &rarr;        </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td colspan = 2>
              M2BA:= false;                   </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td colspan = 2>
              <b>if</b> An &ge; 2 &rarr; skip </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td>&nbsp; </td> <td>
               &#x25af; An = 1 &rarr; An:= 2  </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td colspan = 2>
              <b>fi</b>     .                 </td> </tr>
</table>
The above traffic keeps clearly P1(X) <b>and</b> P2(X) invariant for all
nodes. Because the graph is finite and each edge transmits at most one 
M1-message and hence at most one M2-message, the diffusing computation will
die out; from the fact that then no more messages are sent we conclude
that in the final state we have for each edge AB
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
</td><td><b>non</b> M1AB <b>and</b> (Bn &lt; 2 <b>or</b> <b>non</b> M2BA) .
</td>  </tr>  </table>
Observing for the edge from node A to node B the invariant
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
</td><td>An &ne; 1 <b>or</b> M1AB <b>or</b> M2BA .
</td>  </tr>  </table>
                
we conclude, combining the last two relations, that in the final state we have
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
</td><td>An &ne; 1 <b>or</b> Bn &lt; 2
</td>  </tr>  </table>
for each edge AB . In the final state we can now conclude
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
</td><td>Xn &ge; 2 <b>or</b> <b>non</b> (Q1(X)) <b>and</b> Q2(x))
</td>  </tr>  </table>
as follows. For a node X such that <b>non</b> (Q1(X) <b>and</b> Q2(X)) holds it is 
obviously true. For a node X such that (Q1(X) <b>and</b> Q2(X)) holds,there exists
a path from X to D , all nodes of which have n &ge; 1 . Our latest result
tells us that on that path a node with n &ge; 2 can only be preceded by a node
with n &ne; 1 , hence n &ge; 2 . Because the path ends in node D with Dn &ge; 2 ,
we conclude Xn &ge; 2 , thereby establishing our latest result. Combining our
latest result with P2 we conclude for the final state
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
</td><td><b>non</b> Q1(X) <b>or</b> ((Xn &ge; 2) = Q2(X))  .               
</td>  </tr>  </table>
<p>Summing up: in the final state we have
<br>a node with Xn = 0 satisfies <b>non</b> D1(X) ,
<br>a node with Xn = 1 satisfies Q1(X) <b>and</b> <b>non</b> Q2(X)
<br>a node with Xn = 2 satisfies Q1(x) <b>and</b>  Q2(x) .
<p>Note that after firing &mdash;i.e. autonomously setting its Dn to 2 and
the M1DX&rsquo;S for its outgoing edges to true&mdash; node D acts just like any
other node of the graph. Note also that all the ways in which the M1- and
M2-message traffic may be mixed in time &mdash;a node X with Xn = 2 may still
receive M1-messages&mdash; did not need to be mentioned in our argument.
<p align="center" class="noindent">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>*</p> 
<p>We now turn our attention to the third part of the algorithm, viz.
the detection that D is reachable from all nodes that are reachable from
D . For the sake of the inductive argument required we introduce a rooted
tree T with node D as its root, with edges from the given graph and 
subspanning all nodes reachable from D . (The definition of &ldquo;reachable from
node D &rdquo; implies the existence of such a tree,) Its edges will be called
the &ldquo;T-edges&rdquo;.
            
<p>Let &ldquo;the subtree of node X &rdquo; be defined as that subtree of T of which
node X is the root. For the sake of brevity we introduce the predicate Q3,
defined as
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
Q3(X) =</td><td>&ldquo;node X is reachable from node D and node D is reachable from
all nodes of the subtree of node X &rdquo; .
</td>  </tr>  </table>
<p>Because the subtree of node D is T itself, and T subspans by
definition all nodes reachable from node D , the value of D3(D) is the
answer we are looking for. Because Q3(X) &rArr; (Q1(X) <b>and</b> Q2(X)) , we can use
for the recording whether Q3 has been established for each node the same
variable Xn by virtue of the relation
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
P3(X):</td><td>Xn &lt; 3 <b>or</b> Q3(X)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
which is clearly an invariant of our algorithm developed thus far.
<p>Nodes can send to their predecessors so-called M3-messages meaning
&ldquo;Q3 holds for the sender of this M3-message&rdquo;. A node will send an 
M3-message with this meaning at most once, and only along its one and only incoming
T-edge. With each T-edge we associate a boolean variable that will be used
to record whether it has carried an M3-message. More precisely, with each
T-edge AB we associate a boolean variable that is denoted by M3BA and
assumed to be stored in node A . For the T-edge AB we shall keep the
relation 
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%>  </td><td valign=top>
<b>non</b> M3BA <b>or</b> (Bn &ge; 3)</td><td align=right>(1)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
invariant; it is initially true because M3BA is initialized with the value
false.
<p>For a node X we may conclude that Q3(X) holds, provided
<br>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q3(Y) holds for all &ldquo;T-successors Y of X&rdquo; &mdash;where &ldquo;Y is a
T-successor of X&rdquo; means &ldquo;the edge XY is a T-edge&rdquo;&mdash; <b>and</b>
<br>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q1(X) <b>and</b> Q2(X) holds &mdash;note that X could be a leaf of T!&mdash;
<p>The sending of an M3-message from B to A along its one an only
incoming T-edge can now be represented by the guarded command
                           
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td colspan = 2>
   Bn = 2 <b>and</b> (<u>A</u> X: X is a T-successor of B: M3XB) &rarr; </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
           Bn:= 3;                                                      </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td>
           M3BA:= true .                                                </td> </tr>
</table>
For node D , which has no incoming T-edge, this reduces to recording that
Q3(D) has been established:
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td colspan = 2>
   Dn = 2 <b>and</b> (<u>A</u> X: x is a T-successor of D: M3XD) &rarr; </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
           Dn:= 3   .                                                   </td> </tr>
</table>
It is clear that with this addition the algorithm leaves P1(X) and P2(X) and
P3(X) invariant for each node X . Note that for the M3BA associated with
the T-edge AB we have the invariant stronger than (1):
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
</td><td>M3BA = (Bn &ge; 3) .
</td>  </tr>  </table>
The proof that upon completion we have
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
</td><td>(Dn &gt; 3) = Q3(D)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
is left to the reader.
<p align="center" class="noindent">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>*</p> 
<p>We are now only left with the task of choosing the rooted tree T .
We choose for the T-edges those edges that carry an M1-message that is
accompanied by the transition from n = 0 to n = 1 for its recipient.
It is clear that each node X with Q1(X) is reachable from D via such
edges; it is also clear that each X with Q1(X) that differs from D has
exactly one such incoming edge. Hence they satisfy all properties required
from the edges of the rooted tree T .
<p>With this choice for the tree T , the component of the guard 
controlling the M3-traffic
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
</td><td>(<u>A</u> X: X is a T-successor of B: M3XB)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
presents some implementation problems, because the identities of their 
T-successors are not recorded in nodes. We therefore associate also a boolean
variable M3BA with each non-T-edge AB , and replace the above guard 
component by
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
</td><td>(<u>A</u> X: X is a successor of B: M3XB)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
                
and introduce a further mechanism that can set the M3BA to true for each
non-T-edge AB . Because upon arrival of an M1-message its recipient can
decide whether it received the M1-message via a T-edge or via a non-T-edge,
we can give each recipient of an M1-message via a non-T-edge the obligation
to return along that edge an M3-message meaning &ldquo;the edge along which this
M3-message is carried is not a T-edge&rdquo;. The recipient of that M3-message
need not distinguish between the two meanings of an M3-message: in both
cases it sets the M3BA for that edge to true. With this protocol we would
eventually establish for each non-T-edge AB
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
</td><td><b>non</b> Q1(A) <b>or</b> (M3BA = (Bn &ge; 1)) .
</td>  </tr>  </table>
<p>In the case Q3(D) each edge that has carried an M1-message has to
carry an M2- and an M3-message as well. In the case <b>non</b> Q3(D) 
&mdash;characterized by the existence of a node X with Q1(X) <b>and</b> <b>non</b> Q2(X)&mdash; it would
be permissible to suppress all M3-traffic, and, from the point of efficiency,
the more we suppress, the better. We can achieve suppression by strengthening
the guards controlling the M3-signalling via T-edges by establishing for
a non-T-edge AB eventually
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
</td><td><b>non</b> Q1(A) <b>or</b> (M3BA = (Bn &ge; 2))
</td>  </tr>  </table>
Also in the case Q3(D) this strengthening of the guards is permissible: in
that case &mdash;characterized by the <b>absence</b> of a node X with Q1(X) <b>and</b> <b>non</b>
Q2(X)&mdash; each M3BA of an outgoing non-T-edge of a reachable node will be
set to true, and our initially strengthened component of the guard 
controlling the M3-traffic along T-edges becomes equivalent to the original
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
</td><td>(<u>A</u> X: X is a T-successor of B: M3XB) .
</td>  </tr>  </table>
This means, however, that along non-T-edges the M2- and M3-messages can
be combined into M23-messages.
<p>Incorporating this optimization we get the following solution. For
a non-T-edge it maintains the invariant
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
</td><td>An = 0 <b>or</b> (M3BA = (Bn &ge; 2 <b>and</b> <b>non</b> M1AB <b>and</b> <b>non</b> M2BA)

For node D , which has no incoming T-edge, this reduces to recording that
Q3(D) has been established:
 
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td colspan = 2>
      Dn = 2 <b>and</b> (<u>A</u> X: X is a successor of D: M3XD) &rarr; </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>&nbsp;  </td> <td>
            Dn:= 3                                                       </td> </tr>
</table>
<p>Note that we did not prescribe that along T-edges the M3-messages
are preceded by the M2-messages.
<p align="center" class="noindent">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>*</p> 
<p>The algorithm described above is a diffusing computation that dies out.
In the case action from D is only required if it belongs to a knot, it
suffices &mdash;although it leaves &ldquo;residues&rdquo; in all other nodes&mdash; . Alternatively
we can superimpose the detection mechanism for diffusing computations [1]:
upon receipt of the termination signal in D , the truth of
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
</td><td>(Dn &ne; 3) = Q3(D)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
is guaranteed. (Note that each directed edge of the above, carrying messages
of the diffusing computation possibly in both directions, corresponds to two
edges &mdash;in opposite directions&mdash; in the terminology of [1]. Note further
that node D of the above, which can receive messages, is <b>not</b> the 
&ldquo;environment&rdquo; of [1], and that a (virtual) &ldquo;environment&rdquo; has to be added to the graph
that fires D . Note further that the &ldquo;engagement edges&rdquo; from [1] are not
restricted to the T-edges from the above.) I shall not carry out the 
superposition.     
<p align="center" class="noindent">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>*</p> 
<p>The above has been prompted by Ernest Chang [2], in which the author
&mdash;following R.C.Holt&mdash; reduces deadlock detection to the question whether a
node &mdash;in a bipartite directed graph of &ldquo;processes&rdquo; and &ldquo;resources&rdquo;&mdash; belongs
to a knot. Chang restricts himself to a diffusing computation of which 
termination is not necessarily detected in the case <b>non</b> Q3(D). (Chang&rsquo;s algorithm
&mdash;if correct&mdash; recognizes <b>non</b> Q3(D) explicitly in the trivial case when
there exists a node X with Q1(X) , but without successors at all.)
<p>The main incentive for writing the above was that while reading [2]
I could not decide whether its author had solved the problem or not; neither
could I decide &mdash;if he has solved it&mdash; whether all complexity of his solution
is really required.
                   
<p class=noindent><b>Warning</b>. Those that would like to study Chang&rsquo;s [2] should be warned
that in his programs he attaches &mdash;without explaining his conventions&mdash; a
syntactic role to indentation. (End of warning.)
<p>After spending a number of hours studying [2] I had placed mentally
so many question marks in margine that I decided that there was only one way
to understand his problem: I had to put his text aside and try to solve the
problem myself. Hence this text.
<p>After solving the problem (without pencil and paper, within a few hours)
I spent two days on its first presentation, which was rejected because &mdash;though
much less so than [2]&mdash; parts of my argument were still too operational. (I
had also made the mistake of borrowing some of Chang&rsquo;s &mdash;operationally 
defined! terminology, such as &ldquo;primary&rdquo; and &ldquo;secondary&rdquo; edges.) The writing
of the above text &mdash;my second effort&mdash; took me another three full days, days
that I consider as extremely well-spent. It forced me to separate my four
main concerns &mdash;Q1(X), Q2(X), Q3(X), and the definition of the rooted tree
T &mdash; even more rigorously than I had done before; but even after that had
been achieved, finding the proper notations and deciding upon the proper
amount of essential detail turned out to be a major challenge. (I hope that
I have met it well.)
<p class=noindent><b>Note</b>. For the operationally minded I point out that there is no objection
to regarding the tree T as <b>completely defined, all through the computation</b>.
The objection that, at the beginning of the computation, T is not &ldquo;known&rdquo;
yet, is totally irrelevant: with a modest amount of clairvoyance it is. (End
of Note.)
<p>I must admit that, in the meantime I have lost all incentive to return
to [2] in order to try, once again, whether I can convince myself that Chang&rsquo;s
solution is correct. If I had to referee the paper, I would give the author
on this point the benefit of the doubt, but would recommend unconditional 
rejection of the paper in its current form, because it is much faster to solve
the problem yourself than to try to understand his text. I am also not tempted
                  
to investigate to what extent the complexity of his program is due to a clumsy
coding or to further optimizations that I did not incorporate &mdash;such as the
combination of an M2- and an M3-message into a single M23-message along a
T-edge, whenever possible&mdash; , but he did not disentangle.
<p class=noindent><b>Acknowledgement</b>. I am grateful to the members of the Tuesday Afternoon Club
for explaining with refreshing clarity to me why my first version had to be
rejected. <p><p>
