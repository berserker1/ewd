<p class=noindent><b>On a problem posed by W.H.J.Feijen.</b>
<p>Given, for M &ge; 0 and N &ge; 0 , the strictly increasing sequences
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
</td><td>F(0) &lt; F(1) &lt; ... &lt; F(M-1)
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>
</td><td>G(0) &lt; G(1) &lt; ... &lt; G(N-1)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
and the desired final state
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
R:</td><td>Q(M, N)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
where the predicate Q has been given by
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
Q(m, n):</td><td>(<u>E</u> (i, j): 0 &le; i &lt;m, 0 &le; j &lt; n: F(i) = G(j)) = k
</td>  </tr>  </table>
(the &ldquo;N&rdquo; to be read as: &ldquo;the number of distinct pairs (i, j) with i and
j in the ranges so and so, such that such and such&rdquo;.) W.H.J.Feijen posed
the problem of giving a formal derivation, heuristics included, of an efficient
program establishing R .
<p>The standard way of solving this problem would be &ldquo;Replacing constants
by variables&rdquo;, i.e. would be to introduce two local variables &mdash;which we
shall again denote by my and n &mdash; , their role being given by the invariant
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
P:</td><td>Q(m, n) <b>and</b> 0 &le; m &le; M <b>and</b> 0 &le; n &le; N   .
</td>  </tr>  </table>
easily initialized by
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
</td><td>&ldquo;m, n, k := 0, 0, 0&rdquo;
</td>  </tr>  </table>
and enjoying the obvious property
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%>  </td><td valign=top>
(P <b>and</b> m = M <b>and</b> n = N) &rArr; R .</td><td align=right>(1)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
(It could be remarked that also initializations such as &ldquo;m, n, k := 0, N, 0&rdquo;
or m, n, k := M, 0, 0&ldquo; would have done the job, but symmetry should never
be destroyed lightly.)
<p>Appealing to (1) implies a final state with (m, n) = (M, N) ; the
crucial observation is that the transition to it from the initial state
(m, n) = (0, 0) can be made via so many different paths (increasing m or/
and n by 1 at a time) that we should raise the question whether we can
                        
exploit this freedom by <b>strengthening</b> P into P&rsquo; and by <b>weakening</b> the
condition for termination. (The weaker the condition for termination, the
stronger the guards and the sooner we may expect the repetition to stop.)
We can weaken the condition for termination by not requiring that both the
local variables m and n have reached their maximum value, i.e. we find
ourselves looking for a P&rsquo; , stronger than P , and such that
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%>  </td><td valign=top>
(P&rsquo; and (m = M <b>or</b> <b>and</b> n = N)) &rArr;R</td><td align=right>(2)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
<p>Investigating the case m = M , we find ourselves facing the question:
what more should be known besides P such that we may conclude R ? In
view of the monotonicity of the sequences F and G it would suffice to
know that F(m-1) &lt; G(n) because
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
</td><td>(Q(M, n) <b>and</b> F(M-1) &lt; G(n)) &rArr; R .
</td>  </tr>  </table>
Because we are only interested in the inequality F(M-1) &lt; G(n) &mdash;itself
to strong to be included in the invariant&mdash; the inclusion of F(m-1) &lt; G(n)
would suffice. Hence we find ourselves considering the invariant (symmetry!)
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
P&rsquo;:</td><td>P <b>and</b> F(m-1) &lt; G(n) <b>and</b> G(n-1) &lt; F(m) ,
</td>  </tr>  </table>
an invariant that admits the same initialization if we define formally
F(-1) = G(-1) : minus infinity .
<p>The standard routine of computing wp(&ldquo;m:= m + 1&rdquo;, P&rsquo;), wp(&ldquo;n:= n + 1, P&rdquo;),
and wp(&ldquo;m, n, k := m + 1, n + 1, k + 1&rdquo;, P&ldquo;) and simplifying by omitting
implied terms from the conjunctions gives the guards; the following program
results:
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td colspan = 4>
      m, n, k := 0, 0, 0; {P'}                                             </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td colspan = 4>
