<p><u>Dear Mr.X of Company Y.</u></p>

<p>
You are the n-th (n >> 0) representative of a commercial organization claiming to provide education and training for the computer
professional, that sollicits my cooperation. And for the n-th time my answer is "No.".
</p><p>A sample from your catalogue of services indicates that probably more than half of your courses aim at teaching how to live with --or even: how to convert to!-- IBM products. They may represent &quot;training&quot;, but I cannot call them &quot;education&quot;. The problem how to get useful work done with IBM products seems, indeed, severe --that, at least, is the only conclusion that I can draw from the vast number of courses your profitable company devotes to its numerous aspects--, but the problem seems better evaded than solved. (What about courses how to convert away from IBM products?) Industrial mistakes are <u>not</u> sacrosanct, just because they have been made on a large scale. From an educational point of view, your organization is on --or beyond-- the verge of fraudulence, and your invitation to cooperate with your endeavour can, therefore, be interpreted as an insult.</p><p>
Presumable by way of temptation, you list the names of the "celebrities" of this education circus, whose ranks I could join by
cooperating with your company. (I could even have my photograph reproduced in your next folder! How jolly!) I know most of them.
When their work is sent to me, I leave it lying around in my University office, for the amazement of my visitors: usually it
leaves them flabbergasted to see that such superficial stuff is not only printed, but apparently even sold. I would like you to
understand that there exists a scale of values, according to which your invitation to join that crowd is also no less than an
insult.
</p><p>
Without denying any responsibility for this letter, I may clarify it by explaining to you that it is all my wife's fault. When I
asked her whether she wanted to be married to a millionaire, her immediate answer was "Please not!". When asked what made me pose
that question, I explained to her the "educational circus" --remember Barnum's verdict?-- Kindly she said

<p>
"Please try not to be too rude when you answer the bloke." I have done my best; her only fault is that she did not marry a gigolo.

Well, actually I wrote him:
</p><p>
Dear Mr.X,
</p><p>
thank you for your letter of .... . The enclosed material taught me that I am not a suitable speaker for the intended public,
and hence I concluded that I should decline your invitations.

Sincerely,
