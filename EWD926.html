<h1>A computer to think about</h1>
<div class='body'>
						<p>We all know of the possibility of starting a computer on a nonterminating repetition. This possibility is unfortunate because with the commercial equipment currently available, such a program takes an awful lot of time to execute it. I therefore propose a machine that needs 1 second for the first iteration and furthermore doubles its speed at each iteration.</p>
						<p>Confront a mathematician with this proposal; he will immediately point out that your proposal is <u>logically</u> flawed: in what state will your machine be 2+&epsilon; sec. after it was started? Contradiction!</p>
						<p>Show it to a physicist that knows his good, old Einstein; he immediately sees that, due to the finite velocity of light, one should implement the doubling of the speed by halving the size of the machine at each iteration. Then, after 2 seconds, the contradiction has disappeared, and so has your machine (but that is only fair: any computer irrevocably embarked upon a nonterminating computation is effectively lost).</p>
