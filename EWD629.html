<b>On two beautiful solutions designed by Martin Rem</b>.
<p>(In recent correspondence with dr. Martin Rem &mdash;currently at the Department
of Computer Science (mail code: 256-80), California Institute of Technology,
PASADENA, California 91109, U.S.A.&mdash; he sent me two solutions which I think
both so beautiful, that they deserve a wider distribution; hence their inclusion
in the EWD-series; apart from some historical information and formal elaborations
that have been added, and some cosmetic changes, I have essentially presented
Rem&rsquo;s solutions.) .
<p class=noindent><p><b>A P/V-implementation of conditional critical regions</b>.
<p>Since (by an accident of history) the P- and V-operations on semaphores 
have more or less acquired the status of &ldquo;canonical&rdquo; synchronization primitives,
inventors of new synchronization concepts have related their inventions to 
P- and V-operations in two different ways. Either &mdash;see, for instance, Hoare[1],
concerning monitors&mdash; the new concept is shown to be equally powerful by 
demonstrating that it can be used to implement the P-and V-operations; or &mdash;see,
for instance, Hoare [2] , when introducing the (simple) critical region
&ldquo;<b>with</b> r <b>do</b> S <b>od</b>&rdquo;&mdash; the feasibility of its implementation is argued by showing
how to implement it with P- and V-operations. The latter possibility has now
been demonstrated by Rem for the conditional critical region &ldquo;<b>with</b> r <b>when</b> B <b>do</b> S <b>od</b>&rdquo;
as well. (In [2] , Hoare remarks about the simple critical region &ldquo;If we assume
that a Boolean semaphore mechanism is &ldquo;built-in&rdquo;, the implementation is trivial.&rdquo;
(as indeed it is). When in [2] Hoare introduces the conditional critical regions,
he adds &ldquo;Some care must be exercised in the implementation of this new feature.&rdquo;
and follows with a two paragraph verbal sketch, explaining what has to be done
with a queue of processes waiting for r . In [3] , Brinch Hansen gives a slightly
more detailed sketch of an implementation involving two queues &mdash;&ldquo;queues&rdquo; that
can be recognized in Rem&rsquo;s solution (if looked at abstractly enough)&mdash; but it
is still no more than a sketch. Ironically enough, Rem now solves the problem
by a method &mdash;later called &ldquo;splitting a binary semaphore&rdquo;&mdash; that a few years
ago.... Hoare has taught us!)
<p>In processes so-called &ldquo;conditional critical regions&rdquo; may occurr of the
form
 &ldquo;<b>with</b> r <b>when</b> Bi <b>do</b> S1 <b>od</b>&rdquo; .
Here r denotes a shared variable &mdash;or more generally: a cluster of shared
             
variables&mdash; , such that r is only accessible from within sections of the text
of the form &ldquo;<b>when</b> Bi <b>do</b> Si <b>od</b>&rdquo; that are prefixed by &ldquo;<b>with</b> r&rdquo;. (That this 
constraint is not violated is easily checked by a compiler, a circumstance that is
its major justification.)
<p>As with the simple critical regions &ldquo;<b>with</b> r <b>do</b> Si <b>od</b>&rdquo;, the implementation
has to ensure that the executions of the statements Si &mdash;prefixed by the same
&ldquo;<b>with</b> r&rdquo;&mdash; as they may occur in the different processes, <b>exclude each other in</b>
<b>time</b>. In addition, a statement Si &mdash;like what later would become known as
&ldquo;a guarded command&rdquo;&mdash; is only eligible for execution in those initial states
where Bi holds. The implementation has to ensure that these constraints are
met by delaying, if necessary,  the further execution of the process in which
Si occurs.
<p>A further requirement is that no such delay occurs without justification,
more precisely:
<br>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if no statement Si is under execution &mdash;i.e. the requirement of mutual
exclusion would not constrain the selection of a next &rdquo;Si for execution&mdash;,and
<br>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if for one or more processes the Si of a conditional critical region
is the next statement to be executed and at least one of the corresponding Bi&rsquo;s
is true,
<br>then the selection of such an Si with a true Bi is obligatory.
<p>To make the implementation of this last requirement feasible, a further
constraint ensures that activity of one process, but well outside its regions
critical with respect to r leaves the &ldquo;<b>non</b> Bi&rdquo; for all other processes 
invariantly true. This further constraint is that r is the <b>only</b> shared variable
Bi may depend upon. The whole set of constraints now ensures that the obligation
to inspect whether a false Bi of a delayed process has turned true, can be
concentrated at the point where the execution of an Sj (of another process!)
has been carried to completion.
<p>The technique of the &ldquo;split binary semaphore&rdquo; consists of the introduction
of a set of binary semaphores &mdash;in this example of the three semaphores m , bl ,
and b2 &mdash; of which at most one equals 1 .This can obviously be ensured by
seeing to it that in each program P- and V-operations &mdash;regardless of on which
                
of the three semaphores they operate&mdash; alternate dynamically: each P-operation
decreases their sum by 1 , each V-operation increases their sum by 1 . Furthermore
we can assert that between each P-operation and dynamically subsequent 
V-operation the sum m + b1 + b2 = 0 ; hence the executions of the program sections
between such a P-operation and its subsequent V-operation can be viewed as 
excluding each other mutually in time (if so desired by the traditional argument
of Dijkstra [4]).
<p>Rem&rsquo;s solution uses three semaphores m (=1), b1(=0), and b2(=0), and two
counters n(=0), and nt(=0) &mdash;initial values being given between parentheses&mdash; .
The integer n counts the number of processes &ldquo;eager&rdquo; to perform their Si&rsquo;s ;
during testing, the counter nt is equal to the number of Bi&rsquo;s , the falsity
of which is not guaranteed. The whole critical activity can only end with nt = 0
&mdash;otherwise impermissible delays could result&mdash; . When an Si has been 
performed &mdash;and, therefore, all Bi may have become true&mdash; nt has to be increased
until nt = n before testing can begin. In this latter process the semaphore b1
plays a signalling role; the semaphore b2 is used to admit processes to their
Bi-test one at a time. With this informal sketch of meaning and function of the
semaphores and variables I shall present Rem&rsquo;s solution without further 
annotation; thereafter I shall present a more formal treatment.

<p>For our more formal treatment we introduce angle brackets in order to
indicate that each action extending from an opening bracket until a next (closing)
angle bracket denotes an atomic action. Atomic actions can be viewed as excluding
each other in time. This is OK if each atomic action starts with a P-operation,
ends with a V-operation and has no such operations in between.
                  
<p>For each process we introduce two boolean ghost-variables ai (&ldquo;in the
antichambre&rdquo;) and wi (&ldquo;in the waitingroom&rdquo;). They are initially &rsquo;false; we
shall use the notations (<u>N</u> j: aj) and (<u>N</u> j: wj) respectively to denote the
number of processes for which ai and wi respectively are true. Furthermore
we introduce a global ghost-boolean c &mdash;initally false;- , the truth of which
marks the states in which the implications aj &rArr; <b>non</b> Bj need not hold. Labels
have been inserted for later discussion. The annotated text of the program is
as follows: .

<p>Indicating atomic actions by start- and end-label, we can denote the five
atomic actions we have to consider as follows: L0-L1, L0-L3, L1-L2, L2-L1, and
L2-L3. with the initialization m = 1 , b1 =  b2 = 0 , we readily establish for
all five the invariance of
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
P0:</td><td>m + b1 + b2 = 1 .
</td>  </tr>  </table>
                 
This establishes the property of the &ldquo;split boolean semaphore&rdquo; and tells us that,
indeed, we are entitled to regard the five actions &mdash;each of which starts with
a P-operation on one of the three semaphores and ends (dynamically) with a 
V-operation on one of the semaphores&mdash; as &ldquo;atomic&rdquo;. In particular it guarantees
that the Si are executed under mutual exclusion and under the initial truth
of Bi .
<p>Having established the atomicity, and taking the further initial values
nt = n = 0 and c = false into account, we next establish the invariant truth
of 
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
Pl:</td><td>(m = 1 &rArr; (<b>non</b> c <b>and</b> 0 = nt &le; n ))   <b>and</b>
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>
</td><td>(bl = 1  &rArr; (c <b>and</b> 0 &le; nt &lt; n))   <b>and</b>
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>
</td><td>(b2 = 1  &rArr; (<b>non</b> c <b>and</b> 0 &lt; nt &le; n))
</td>  </tr>  </table>
The invariance of P1 is easily established, as is indicated by the assertions
that annotate the program text. (Note that it seems to be the function of the
ghost-boolean c to make the three consequents mutually exclusive.)
<p>With the further knowledge that initially all the wi are false, we easily
establish the invariant truth of
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
P2:</td><td>(<u>N</u> j: wj) = nt .
</td>  </tr>  </table>
Because (<u>N</u> j: wj) = the number of processes at L2, ready to perform P(b2) ,
we conclude now that on account of the third implication of P1 , a deadlock
cannot occur after the execution of V(b2) .
<p>With the further knowledge that initially all the ai are false, we easily
establish the invariant truth of
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
P3:</td><td>(<u>N</u> j: aj) = n - nt .
</td>  </tr>  </table>
Because (<u>N</u> j: aj) = the number of processes at L1, ready to perform P(b1) ,
we conclude now that on account of the second implication of P1 , a deadlock
cannot occur after the execution of V(b1) .
<p>(A &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; or &ldquo;partial&rdquo; deadlock can occur after the execution of V(m) ;
&rsquo;then, however, the state m = 1 holds, and the assumption is that sooner or
later another process will &ldquo;join the game&rdquo; via L0 .)
EWD629 - 5
<p>Finally we establish the invariant truth of
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
P4:</td><td>(<u>A</u> j: aj &rArr; (<b>non</b> B <b>or</b> c)) ,
</td>  </tr>  </table>
which holds initially because then all antecedents are false. We shall check
its invariance explicitly.
<br>L0-L3 and L2-L3 could make all Bj&rsquo;s true as a result of Si&rsquo;s modification
of r ; the assignment c:= (nt &lt; n) , however, makes all implications of F4
hold: if c is established by it, all consequents are true, if <b>non</b> c is
established by it, we conclude nt = n , and P3 then tells us, that all 
antecedents are false; in both cases all implications of P4 hold vacuously.
L0-L1 and L2-L1 could only affect the i&rsquo;th implication, but they don&rsquo;t do
so as ai:= true is executed under the truth of its consequent, viz. <b>non</b> Bi.
In L1-L2 , the assignment ai:= false strengthens an antecedent, and therefore
is safe; the assignment c:= false may strengthen any consequent, but &mdash;see
P3&mdash; is executed under falsity of all antecedents and, therefore, is safe as
well. This concludes our demonstration of the invariance of P4 .
<p>Combining (the first implication of) P1, P3, and P4 we conclude
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
</td><td>m = 1 &rArr; ((<u>N</u> j: aj) = n <b>and</b> (<u>A</u> j: aj &rArr; <b>non</b> Bj)).
</td>  </tr>  </table>
thus expressing that no avoidable delay is introduced.
