<p class=noindent><b>Finding the correctness proof of a concurrent program</b>.
<p class=noindent><b>Introduction</b>.
<p>In this paper we want to do more than just giving another &mdash;be it 
unusual&mdash; example of the utility of the first-order predicate calculus in
proving the correctness of programs. In addition we want to show how,
thanks to a systematic use of the first-order predicate calculus, fairly
general &mdash;almost &ldquo;syntactic&rdquo;&mdash; considerations about the formal manipulations
involved can provide valuable guidance for the smooth discovery of an 
otherwise surprising argument.
<p>For proofs of program correctness two fairly different styles have
been developed, &ldquo;operational&rdquo; proofs and &ldquo;assertional&rdquo; proofs. Operational
correctness proofs are based on a model of computation, and the corresponding
computational histories are the subject matter of the considerations. In
assertional correctness proofs the possibility of interpreting the program
text as executable code is ignored and the program text itself is the subject
matter of the formal considerations.
<p>Operational proofs &mdash;although older and, depending on one&rsquo;s education,
perhaps more &ldquo;natural&rdquo; than_assertional proofs&mdash; have proved to be tricky to
design. For more complicated programs the required classification of the
possible computational histories tends to lead to an exploding case analysis
in which it becomes very clumsy to verify that no possible sequence of events
has been overlooked, and it was in response to the disappointing experiences
with operational proofs that the assertional style has been developed.
<p>The design of an assertional proof &mdash;as we shall see below&mdash; may 
present problems, but, on the whole, experience seems to indicate that assertional
proofs are much more effective than operational ones in reducing the gnawing
uncertainty whether nothing has been overlooked. This experience, already
gained while dealing with sequential programs, was strongly confirmed while
dealing with concurrent programs: the circumstance that the ratios of the
speeds with which the sequential components proceed is left undefined greatly
increases the class of computational histories that an operational argument
would have to cover!
                        
<p>In the following we shall present the development of an assertional
correctness proof of a program of N-fold concurrency. The program has been
taken from the middle of a whole sequence of concurrent programs of 
increasing complexity &mdash;the greater complexity at the one end being the consequence
of finer grains of interleaving&mdash; . For brevity&lsquo;s sake we have selected here
from this sequence the simplest item for which the assertional correctness
proof displays the characteristic we wanted to show. (It is got the purpose
of this paper to provide supporting material in favour of the assertional
style: in fact, our example is so simple that an operational proof for it
is still perfectly feasible.)
<p align="center" class="noindent">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>*</p> 
<p>In the following y denotes a vector of N components y[i] for
0 &le; i &lt; N . With the identifier f we shall denote a vector-valued function
of a vector-valued argument, and the algorithm concerned solves the equation
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%>  </td><td valign=top>
y = f(y)</td><td align=right>(1)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
or, introducing f<sub>0</sub>, f<sub>1</sub>, f<sub>2</sub>,... for the components of f
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%>  </td><td valign=top>
y[i] = f<sub>i</sub>(y) for 0 &le; i &lt; N .</td><td align=right>(2)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
<p>It is assumed that the initial value of y and the function f are
such that repeated assignments of the form
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%>  </td><td valign=top>
&lt;y[i]== f<sub>i</sub>(y) &gt;</td><td align=right>(3)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
will lead in a finite number of steps to y being a solution of (1). In
(3) we have used Lamport&rsquo;s notation of the angle brackets: they enclose
&ldquo;atomic actions&rdquo; which can be implemented by ensuring between their 
executions mutual exclusion in time. For the sake of termination we assume that
the sequence of i-values for which the assignments (3) are carried out is
(the proper begin of) a sequence in which each i-value occurs infinitely
often. (We deem this property guaranteed by the usual assumption of &ldquo;finite
speed ratios&rdquo;; he who refuses to make that assumption can read the following
as a proof of partial correctness.)
<p>For the purpose of this paper it suffices to know that functions f
exist such that with a proper initial value of y equation (1) will be solved
            
by a finite number of assignments (3). How for a given function f and
initial value y this property can be established is ggt the subject of
this paper. (He who refuses to assume that the function f and the initial
value of y have this property is free to do so: he can, again, read the
following as a proof of partial correctness that states that <b>when</b> our
concurrent program has terminated, (1) is satisfied.)
<p>Besides the vector y there is &mdash;for the purpose of controlling 
termination&mdash; a vector h , with boolean elements h[i] for 0 &le; i &lt; N , all
of which are true to start with. We now consider the following program of
N-fold concurrency, in which each atomic action assigns a value to at most
one of the array elements mentioned. We give the program first and shall
explain the notation afterwards.
The concurrent program we are considering consists of the following
N components (0 &le; i &lt; N):
<table> <tr> <td colspan = 5>
cpnt<sub>i</sub>:                                                               </td> </tr> <tr> <td>L0: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td colspan = 4>

                  &#x25af; y[i] &ne; f<sub>i</sub>(y) &rarr; y[i]:= f<sub>i</sub>(y) &gt; ; </td> </tr> <tr> <td>L2j:</td> <td></td> <td></td> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
                                (<u>A</u> j: &lt; h[j]:= true &gt; )  </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td colspan = 3>
                <b>fi</b>                                             </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td colspan = 4>
       <b>od</b>                                                      </td> </tr>
</table>
<p>In line L0 , &ldquo;(<u>E</u> j: h[j])&rdquo; is an abbreviation for 
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=20%>
</td><td>(<u>E</u> j: 0 &le; j &lt; N: h[j]) ;
</td>  </tr>  </table>
for the sake of brevity we shall use this abbreviation throughout this paper.
By writing &lt; (<u>E</u> j: h[j]) &gt; in the guard we have indicated that the inspection
whether a true h[j] can be found is an atomic action.
The opening angle bracket &ldquo; &lt; &rdquo; in L1 has two corresponding closing
brackets, corresponding to the two &ldquo;atomic alternatives&rdquo;; it means that in
the same atomic actions the guards are evaluated and either &ldquo;h[i]:= false&rdquo;
or &ldquo;y[i]:= f<sub>i</sub>(y)&rdquo; is executed. In the latter case, N separate atomic
actions follow, each setting an h[j] to true: in line L2j we have used
            
the abbreviation &rdquo;(<u>A</u> j: &lt; h[j]:= true &gt; )&ldquo; for the program that performs
the N atomic actions &lt; h[0]:= true &gt; through &lt; h[N-1]:= true &gt; in some
order which we don&rsquo;t specify any further.
In our target state y is a solution of (1), or, more explicitly
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%>  </td><td valign=top>
(<u>A</u> j: y[j] = f<sub>j</sub>(y)) .</td><td align=right>(4)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
holds. We first observe that (4) is an invariant of the repeatable statements,
i.e. once true it remains true. In the alternative constructs always the
first atomic alternative will then be selected, and this leaves y , and
hence (4) unaffected. We can even conclude a stronger invariant
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%>  </td><td valign=top>
<b>non</b> (<u>E</u> j: h[j]) <b>and</b> (<u>A</u> j: y[j] = f<sub>j</sub>(y))</td><td align=right>(5)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
or, equivalently
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%>  </td><td valign=top>
(<u>A</u> j: <b>non</b> h[j]) <b>and</b> (<u>A</u> j: y[j] = f<sub>j</sub>(y))</td><td align=right>(5&rsquo;)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
for, when (5) holds, no assignment h[i]:= false can destroy the truth of
(<u>A</u> j: <b>non</b> h[j]) . when (4) holds, the assumption of finite speed ratios
implies that within a finite number of steps (5) will hold. But then the
guards of the repetitive constructs are false, and all components will terminate
nicely with (4) holding. The critical point is: can we guarantee that none
of the components terminates too soon?
<p>We shall give an assertional proof, following the technique which has
been pioneered by Gries and Owicki [1]. We call an assertion &rdquo;universally
true&ldquo; if and only if it holds between any two atomic actions &mdash;i.e. &rdquo;always&ldquo;
with respect to the computation, &rdquo;everywhere&ldquo; with respect to the text&mdash; .
More precisely: proving the universal truth of an assertion amounts to showing
<br>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that it holds at initialization
<br>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that its truth is an invariant of each atomic action.
<p>In order to prove that none of the components terminates too soon, i.e.
that termination implies that (4) holds, we have to prove the universal truth of
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%>  </td><td valign=top>
(<u>E</u> j: h[j]) <b>or</b> (<u>A</u> j: y[j] = f<sub>j</sub>(y)) .</td><td align=right>(6)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
Relation (6) certainly holds when the N components are started because
initially all h[j] are true. We are only left with the obligation to
prove the invariance of (6); the remaining part of this paper is devoted
to that proof, and to how it can be discovered.
               
<p>We get a hint of the difficulties we may expect when trying to prove
the invariance of (6) with respect to the first atomic alternative of L1:
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
</td><td>&lt; y[i] = f<sub>i</sub>(y) &rarr; h[i]:= false &gt;
</td>  </tr>  </table>
as soon as we realize that the first term of (6) is a compact notation for
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%>  </td><td valign=top>
h[0] <b>or</b> h[1] <b>or</b> h[2] <b>or</b> ... <b>or</b> h[N-1]</td><td align=right>
</td>  </tr>  </table>
which only changes from true to false when, as a result of &ldquo;h[i]:= false&rdquo;
the <b>last</b> true h[j] disappears. That is ugly!
<p>We often prove mathematical theorems by proving a stronger &mdash;but,
somehow, more manageable&mdash; theorem instead. In direct analogy: instead
of trying to prove the invariant truth of (6) directly, we shall try to
prove the invariant truth of a stronger assertion that we get by replacing
the conditions y[j] = f<sub>j</sub>(y) by stronger ones. Because <b>non</b> R is stronger
than Q provided (Q <b>or</b> R) holds, we can strengthen (6) into
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%>  </td><td valign=top>
(<u>E</u> j= h[j]) <b>or</b> (<u>A</u> j: non R<sub>j</sub>)</td><td align=right>(7)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
provided 
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%>  </td><td valign=top>
(<u>A</u> j: y[j] = f<sub>j</sub>(y) <b>or</b> R<sub>j</sub>)</td><td align=right>(8)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
holds. (Someone who sees these heuristics presented in this manner for the
first time may experience this as juggling, but I am afraid that it is quite
standard and that we had better get used to it.)
<p>What have we gained by the introduction of the N predicates R<sub>j</sub> ?
Well, the freedom to choose them! More precisely: the freedom to <b>define</b>
them in such a way that we can <b>prove</b> the universal truth of (8) &mdash;which is
structurally quite pleasant&mdash; in the usual fashion, while the universal truth
of (7) &mdash;which is structurally equally &ldquo;ugly&rdquo; as (6)&mdash; follows more or less
directly from the <b>definition</b> of the R<sub>j</sub>&rsquo;s : that is the way in which we
may hope that (7) is more &ldquo;manageable&rdquo; than the original (6).
<p>In order to find a proper definition of the R<sub>j</sub>&rsquo;s, we analyse our
obligation to <b>prove</b> the invariance of (8).
If we only looked at the invariance of (8), we might think that a
definition of the R<sub>j</sub>&rsquo;s in terms of y :
               
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%>  </td><td valign=top>
R<sub>j</sub> = (y[j] &ne; f<sub>j</sub>(y))</td><td align=right>
</td>  </tr>  </table>
would be a sensible choice. A moment&rsquo;s reflection tells us that that
definition does not help: it would make (8) universally true by definition,
and the right-hand terms of (6) and (7) would be identical, whereas under the
truth of (8), (7) was intended to be stronger than (6).
<p>For two reasons we are looking for a definition of the R<sub>j</sub>&rsquo;s in which
the y does <b>not</b> occur: firstly, it is then that we can expect the proof of
the universal truth of (8) to amount to something &mdash;and, thereby, to contribute
to the argument&mdash; , secondly, we would like to conclude the universal truth
of (7) &mdash;which does not mention y at all!&mdash; from the <b>definition</b> of the
R<sub>j</sub>&rsquo;s . In other words, we propose a definition of the R<sub>j</sub>&rsquo;s which does not
refer to y at all: only with such a definition <b>does</b> the replacement of
(6) by (7) and (8) localize our dealing with y completely to the proof
of the universal truth of (8).
<p>Because we want to define the R<sub>j</sub>&rsquo;s independently of y , because
initially we cannot assume that for some j-value y[j] = f<sub>j</sub>(y) holds, and
because (8) must hold initially, we must guarantee that initially
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%>  </td><td valign=top>
(<u>A</u> j: R<sub>j</sub>)</td><td align=right>(9)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
holds. Because, initially, all the h[j] are true, the initial truth of
(9) is guaranteed if the R<sub>j</sub>&rsquo;s are defined in such a way that we have
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%>  </td><td valign=top>
(<u>E</u> j: <b>non</b> h[j]) <b>or</b> (<u>A</u> j: R<sub>j</sub>) .</td><td align=right>(10)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
We observe, that (10) is again of the recognized ugly form we are trying to
get rid of. We have some slack &mdash;that is what the R<sub>j</sub>&rsquo;s are being 
introduced for&mdash; and this is the moment to decide to try to come away with a
stronger &mdash;but what we have called: &ldquo;structurally more pleasant&rdquo;&mdash; relation
for the definition of the R<sub>j</sub>&rsquo;s , from which (10) immediately follows. The
only candidate I can think of is
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%>  </td><td valign=top>
(A j: <b>non</b> h[j] <b>or</b> R<sub>j</sub>)</td><td align=right>(11)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
and we can already divulge that, indeed, (11) will be one of the defining
equations for the R<sub>j</sub>&rsquo;s .
<p>From (11) it follows that the algorithm will now start with all the
                   
R<sub>j</sub>&rsquo;s true. From (8) it follows that the truth of R<sub>j</sub> can be appreciated
as &ldquo;the equation y[j] = f<sub>j</sub>(y) need not be satisfied&rdquo;, and from (7) it follows
that in our final state we must have all the R<sub>j</sub>&rsquo;s  equal to false.
<p>Let us now look at the alternative construct
<table> <tr> <td align=right>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;L1: </td> <td colspan = 3>
      &lt;<b>if</b> y[i] = f<sub>i</sub>(y) &rarr; h[i]:= false &gt;            </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp;</td> <td colspan = 2>
          &#x25af; y[i] &ne; f<sub>i</sub>(y) &rarr; y[i]:= f(y) &gt;;          </td> </tr> <tr> <td align=right>L2j:</td> <td></td> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
                                 (<u>A</u> j: &lt; h[j]:= true &gt;) </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td colspan = 2>
          <b>fi</b>                                                  </td> </tr>
</table>
We observe that the first alternative sets h[i] false, and that the second
one, as a whole, sets all h[j] true. As far as the universal truth of (11)
is concerned, we therefore conclude that in the first alternative R<sub>i</sub> is 
allowed to, and hence <b>may</b> become false, but that in the second alternative as a
whole, all R<sub>j</sub>'s <b>must</b> become true.
<p>Let us now confront the two atomic alternatives with (8). Because,
when the first atomic alternative is selected, only y[i] = f<sub>i</sub>(y) has been
observed, the universal truth of (8) is guaranteed to be an invariant of the
first atomic alternative, provided it enjoys the following property (12):
<p>In the execution of the first atomic alternative
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%>  </td><td valign=top>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt; y[i] = f<sub>i</sub>(y) &rarr; h[i]:= false &gt;</td><td align=right>
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>  </td><td valign=top>
<b>no</b> R<sub>j</sub> for j &ne; i changes from true to false.</td><td align=right>(12)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
<p>Confronting the second atomic alternative
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
</td><td>&lt; y[i] &ne; f<sub>i</sub>(y) &rarr; y[i]:= f<sub>i</sub>(y) &gt;
</td>  </tr>  </table>
with (8), and observing that upon its completion <b>none</b> of the relations
y[j] = f<sub>j</sub>(y) needs to hold, we conclude that the second atomic alternative
itself must already cause a final state in which all the R<sub>j</sub>&rsquo;s are true,
in spite of the fact that the subsequent assignments h[j]:= true &mdash;which
would each force an R<sub>j</sub> to true on account of (11)&mdash; have not been executed
yet. In short: in our definition for the R<sub>j</sub>&rsquo;s we must include besides
(11) <b>another</b> reason why an R<sub>j</sub> should be defined to be true.
<p>As it stands, the second atomic alternative only modifies y but we
had decided that the definition of the R<sub>j</sub>&rsquo;s would not be expressed in terms
       
of y ! The only way in which we can formulate the additional reason for an
R<sub>j</sub> to be true is in terms of an <b>auxiliary</b> variable (to be introduced in a
moment), whose value is changed in conjunction with the assignment to y[i] .
The value of that auxiliary variable has to force each R, to true until the
subsequent assignment &lt; h[j]:= true &gt; does so via (11). Because the second,
atomic alternative is followed by N subsequent, separate atomic actions
&lt; h[j]:= true &gt; &mdash;one for each value of j &mdash; , it stands to reason that we
introduce for the i-th component cpnt<sub>i</sub> an auxiliary local boolean array
s<sub>i</sub> with elements s<sub>i</sub>[j] for 0 &le; j &lt; N . Their initial (and &ldquo;neutral&rdquo;)
value is true. The second atomic alternative of L1 sets them all to false,
the atomic statements L2j will reset them to true one at a time.
<p>In contrast to the variables y and h , which are accessible to
all components &mdash;which is expressed by calling them &ldquo;global variables&rdquo;&mdash; ,
each variable s<sub>i</sub> is only accessible to its corresponding component cpnt<sub>i</sub>
&mdash;which is expressed by calling the variable s<sub>i</sub> &ldquo;local&rdquo; to component
as is usual in annotating or verifying sequential programs. If a local
assertion contains only local variables, it can be justified on account of
the text of the corresponding component only.
<p>Local variables give rise to so-called "local assertions".  Local
assertions are most conveniently written in the program text of the 
individual components at the place corresponding to their truth:  they state
a truth between preceding and succeeding statements in exactly the same way
as is usual in annotating or verifying sequential programs.  If a local
assertion contains only local variables, it can be justified on account of
the text of the corresponding component only.
<p>In the following annotated version of  cpnt<sub>i</sub>  we have inserted local
assertions between braces.  In order to understand the local assertions about
s<sub>i</sub>  it suffices to remember that  s<sub>i</sub>  is local to  cpnt<sub>i</sub> .  The local
assertion  {R<sub>i</sub>}  in the second atomic alternative of  Ll  is justified by
the  guard   y[i] &ne; f<sub>i</sub>(y). in conjunction with (8).  We have further 
incorporated in our annotation the consequence of (12) and the fact that the
execution of a second alternative will never cause an  R<sub>j</sub>  to become false:
a true  R<sub>j</sub>  can only become false by virtue of the execution of the first
alternative of  Ll  by  cpnt<sub>i</sub>  itself!  Hence,  R<sub>i</sub>  is true all through the
execution of the second alternative of  cpnt<sub>i</sub>  .

On account of (11)  R<sub>j</sub>  will be true upon completion of  L2j . But
the second atomic alternative of  Ll  should already have made  R<sub>j</sub>  true,
and it should remain so until  L2j  is executed.  The precondition of  L2j,
as given in the annotation, hence tells us the &ldquo;other reason besides
<table width=100%>

(A j: <b>non</b> h[j] <b>or</b> R<sub>j</sub>)</td><td align=right>(11)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
why an  R<sub>j</sub>  should be defined to be true&rdquo;:
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%>  </td><td valign=top>
(A i, j: <b>non</b> R<sub>i</sub> <b>or</b> s<sub>i</sub>[j] <b>or</b> R<sub>j</sub>)</td><td align=right>(13)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
Because it is our aim to get eventually all the  R<sub>j</sub>'s  false, we <b>define</b>
the  R<sub>j</sub>'s  as the <b>minimal</b> solution of (11) and (13), minimal in the sense
of:  as few  R<sub>j</sub>'s  true as possible.
<p>The existence of a unique minimal solution of (11) and (13) follows
from the following construction.  Start with all  R<sub>j</sub>'s  false &mdash;all equations
of (13) are then satisfied on account of the term  &ldquo;<b>non</b> R<sub>i</sub>&rdquo; &mdash; .  If all
equations of (11) are satisfied as well, we are ready &mdash;no true  R<sub>j</sub>'s  at
all&mdash; ; otherwise (11) is satisfied by setting  R<sub>j</sub>  to true for all j-values
for which  h[j]  holds.  Now all equations of (11) are satisfied, but some
of the equations of (13) need no longer be satisfied: as long as an (i, j)-
pair can be found for which the equation of (13) is not satisfied, satisfy it
by setting that  R<sub>j</sub>  to true:  as this cannot cause violation of (11) we
end up with the  R<sub>j</sub>'s  being a solution of (11) and (13).  But it is also
the minimal solution, because any  R<sub>j</sub>  true in this solution must be true
in any solution.
<p>For a value of i , for which
                    
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%>  </td><td valign=top>
(<u>A</u> j: s<sub>i</sub>[j])</td><td align=right>(14)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
holds, the above construction tells us that the truth of R<sub>i</sub> forces no
further true R<sub>j</sub>&rsquo;s via (13); consequently, when such an R<sub>i</sub> becomes false,
no other R<sub>j</sub>-values are then affected. This, and the fact that the first
atomic alternative of L1 is executed under the truth of (14) tells us,
that with our definition of the R<sub>j</sub>&rsquo;s as the minimal solution of (11) and (13),
requirement (12) is, indeed, met.
<p>We have proved the universal truth of (8) by defining the R<sub>j</sub>&rsquo;s as
the minimal solution of (11) and (13). The universal truth of (7), however,
is now obvious. If the left-hand term of (7) is false, we have
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%>  </td><td valign=top>
(<u>A</u> j:<b>non</b> h[j]),</td><td align=right>
</td>  </tr>  </table>
and (11) and (13) have as minimal solution all R<sub>j</sub>&rsquo;s false, i.e.
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%>  </td><td valign=top>
(<u>A</u> j: <b>non</b> R<sub>j</sub>)</td><td align=right>,
</td>  </tr>  </table>
which is the second term of (7). From the universal truth of (7) and (8),
the universal truth of (6) follows, and our proof is completed.
<p class=noindent><b>Concluding remarks</b>.
<p>This note has been written with many purposes in mind:

the formal manipulations involved can provide valuable guidance for the

a formal discipline can assist &ldquo;creativity&rdquo; instead of &mdash;as is sometimes
suggested&mdash; hampering it.
