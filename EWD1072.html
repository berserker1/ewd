  <h1>On covering a figure with diamonds</h1>
  <div class='body'>
				<p>In the <i>American Mathematical Monthly</i> (May 1989, pp.429&ndash;431), under the title &ldquo;The Problem of the Calissons&rdquo;, Guy David and Carlos Tomei present the theorem given below. Before formulating the theorem, we introduce some terminology.</p>
				<p>We consider a regular triangularization of the Euclidean plane, the grid lines of which cut up the plane into equilateral triangles with sides of length 1; in the following, &ldquo;triangle&rdquo; refers to such an equilateral triangle. Note that triangles occur in two orientations and that we can colour them accordingly, e.g.</p>
				<p class="noindent" align="center"><img src="ewd1072_fig1.png" alt="EWD1072 figure 1" title="EWD1072 figure 1" /></p>
				<p class="noindent">A pair of differently coloured triangles that share a side is referred to a &ldquo;diamond&rdquo;, and a moment&rsquo;s reflection tells us that each diamond has one of three possible orientations, viz.</p>
				<p class="noindent" align="center"><img src="ewd1072_fig2.png" alt="EWD1072 figure 2" title="EWD1072 figure 2" /></p>
				<p class="noindent">A &ldquo;figure&rdquo; is a finite set of triangles; a &ldquo;covering&rdquo;of a figure is a partitioning of the figure&rsquo;s triangles into diamonds.</p>
				<p>The theorem presented by David and Tomei states that in any covering of a regular hexagon with sides of length &nbsp; <var>n</var> &nbsp; (and comprising 6<var>n</var> triangles), the diamonds occur in the three orientations in equal numbers.</p>
				<p class="noindent" align="center"><sup>*</sup> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <sub>*</sub> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <sup>*</sup></p>
				<p>Because of the rotational symmetry of the hexagon, the above theorem is an immediate consequence of the following one.</p>
				<p class="noindent"><u>Theorem</u> &nbsp; Consider a figure that admits one or more coverings. Each covering yields a triple of frequencies, each counting the diamonds in one of the orientations. All coverings of the figure considered yield the same triple.</p>
				<p>With the aid of some colleagues, we found for the latter theorem an argument so sweet that it was submitted to the AMM and accepted for publication. But then I withdrew it when I learned that undergraduate students at the Pontifcia Universidade Catlica do Rio de Janeiro knew the following, much shorter proof.</p>
				<p>Consider a covering of the figure. Draw in each diamond a vector from the centre of its white triangle to the centre of its black triangle. Denote the three possible vectors by &nbsp; <var>&#x03BE;</var>,<var>&#x03B7;</var>,<var>&#x03B6;</var> &nbsp; and the triple of their frequencies by &nbsp;<var>x</var>,<var>y</var>,<var>z</var>&nbsp;. By adding all these vectors in the covering of the figure, we get the vector equation</p>
				<p class="noindent" align="center"><var>x</var>&#x2219;<var>&#x03BE;</var> + <var>y</var>&#x2219;<var>&#x03B7;</var> + <var>z</var>&#x2219;<var>&#x03B6;</var> = (the sum of the black centres) &ndash; (the sum of the white centres)&nbsp;.</p>
				<p class="noindent">Moreover we have the scalar equation</p>
				<p class="noindent" align="center"><var>x</var> + <var>y</var> + <var>z</var> =  half the number of triangles in the figure&nbsp;.</p>
				<p class="noindent">These three independent linear equations in <var>x</var>,<var>y</var>,<var>z</var> have right-hand sides wholly determined by the figure, and hence determine the triple of frequencies independent of the covering.</p>
				<p>I thought the above, as yet anonymous argument too beautiful not to be publicly recorded.</p>
