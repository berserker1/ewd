  <b>Self-stabilization with four-state machines</b>.
<p>We consider a sequence of N+1 finite state machines, numbered from
0 through N; two machines are &ldquo;neighbours&rdquo; if and only if their ordinal
numbers differ by 1.
<p>For each machine one or more &ldquo;privileges&rdquo; are defined, i.e. boolean
functions of its own state and the state(s) of its neighbour(s). A &ldquo;move&rdquo;
consists of selecting one of the privileges currently present and bringing
the machine enjoying it in a new state that must be a function of its old
state, the state(s) of its neighbour(s) and the privilege selected (the
latter can only apply in the case of a machine that can enjoy more than
one privilege simultaneously).
<p>We call a state of the total system &ldquo;legitimate&rdquo; if and only if
<table><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
1)</td><td>exactly one privilege is present and, therefore,exactly one move
is possible, and
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>
2)</td><td>the execution of the only possible move will again bring the total
system in a legitimate state, and
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>
3)</td><td>successive moves will cause each privilige to be present with equal
frequency.
</td>  </tr>  </table>
<p>We are interested in designing a set of machines, privileges and
machines, such that, in addition, the system enjoys the property 
of&ldquo;selfstabilization&rdquo;, i.e. regardless the initial state and regardless the
privilege selected for the next move, it must always be possible to do
a next move and after a finite number of moves the total system must arrive
at a legitimate state. It is the requirement of self-stabilization that
makes the problem non-trivial.
<p>For each machine nr.i (0 &le; i &le; N) we introduce two booleans, called
&ldquo;x[i]&rdquo; and &ldquo;up[i]&rdquo; respectively. In the &ldquo;bottom machine&rdquo; up[0] = <b>true</b>
holds permanently, in the &ldquo;top machine&rdquo; up[N] = <b>false</b> holds permanently,
all other booleans are variables. In other words, the top machine and the
bottom machine are two-state machines, the so-called &ldquo;normal machines&rdquo;
(i.e. 0 &lt; i &lt; N) are four-state machines.
<p>For all machines nr.i with 0 &lt; i &le; N the &ldquo;privilege from below&rdquo; is
defined as
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
           x[i] &ne; x[i-1] : </td> </tr>
</table>
<p>for the normal machines the corresponding move is defined as
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
       x[i]:= <b>non</b> x[i]; up[i]:= <b>true</b> </td> </tr>
</table>
but for the top machine &mdash;who has up[N] = <b>false</b> permanent1y&mdash; the move is
reduced to 
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
           x[N]:= <b>non</b> x[N] . </td> </tr>
</table>
<p>For all machines nr.i with 0 &le; i &lt; N the &ldquo;privilege from above&rdquo; is
defines as              
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
       x[i] = x]i+1] <b>and</b> up[i] <b>and</b> <b>non</b> up[i+1]                      : </td> </tr>
</table>
<p>for the normal machine the corresponding move is defined as
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
       up[i]:= <b>false</b> </td> </tr>
</table>
but for the bottom machine &mdash;who has up[0] = true permanently&mdash; the move is
given by 
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
         x[0]:= <b>non</b> x[0] . </td> </tr>
</table>
<p>If neither machine nr.0 nor machine nr.1 is to have a privilege,
x[1] = x[0] and up[1] = <b>true</b> should hold; if in addition machine nr.2 should
also have no privilege, x[2] = x[1] and up[2] = <b>true</b> should hold as well.
Repeating the argument we see that the assumption of &ldquo;no privilege at all&rdquo;
would lead to the conclusion up[N] = <b>true</b>, but as this contradicts the
truth we conclude
<p>Theorem 1: There is at least one privilege.
<p>Furthermore we can conclude &mdash;the proofs are left to the reader&mdash;
<p>Theorem 2: Each move destroys the privilege that allowed it.
<p>Theorem 3: If machine nr.0 has a privilege, machine nr.1 has not a
privilege from below; a move by machine nr.0 will give a privilege from
below to machine nr.1.
<p>Theorem 4: If machine nr.N has a privilege, machine nr.N-1 has not
a privilege from above; a move by machine nr.N may give a privilege from
above to machine nr.N-1 (and will certainly do so in the legitimate state
on account of Theorems 1 and 2).
<p>Theorem 5: If a normal machine nr.i does a move on account of a
privilege from above, it can only affect the privileges held by nr.i and
by nr.-1; machine nr.i is sure to lose its privilege from above, a new
privilege from above may be created for machine nr.i-1 (and this will
certainly happen in the legitimate state on account of Theorems 1 and 2).
<p>Theorem 6: If a normal machine nr.i does a move on account of a
privilege from below, it can only affect the privileges held by nr.i and
by nr.i+1. There are now two cases to consider:
<br>a) Originally x[i] &ne; x[i+1] : machine nr.i and machine nr.i+1 will both
lose their privilege from below, for machine nr.i a new privilege from
above may be created;
<br>b) Originally x[i] = x[i+1] : machine nr.i will lose all its privileges
and for machine nr.i+1 a new privilege from below will be created (and this
will certainly happen in the legitimate state on account of Theorems 1 and 2).
<p class="noindent">Corrolary 1: If a normal machine nr.i does a move on account of a privilege
from below (above) and this privilege is not transferred to machine nr.i+1
(nr.i-1), then the total number of privileges is decreased.
<br>Corrolary 2: No move increases the total number of privileges.
<br>Corrolary 3: A normal machine enjoying both privileges cannot do a move
without reducing the total number of privileges.
<p>From the above it follows that in the legitimate state a privilege
from below will go upward until the top machine reflects it as a privilege
from above, until that again is reflected by the bottom machine as a
privilege from below, etc. All our requirements of the legitimate state
have been met. Self-stabilization now follows from the corrolaries.
<p>We can ask ourselves: what is the minimum value for k(N), such that 
after k(N) moves the system must be in a legitimate state? The answer is
that k(2) = 2 and for N &gt; 2, k(N) = N<SUP>2</SUP>- N + 1. My demonstration for this
result is unelegant and the exact value of the bound is not important
enough to waste printing space on it.
<p align="center" class="noindent">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>*</p> 
<p>More important is the question, whether we can eliminate &mdash;or rather:
distribute&mdash; the tacitly assumed demon, who was supposed to see to it that
at any moment in time only one move was made. For this purpose we assume
that each machine state is equipped with a private switch, guaranteeing that
while a machine changes its state, no neighbour can inspect it; the changing
or inspecting of a state are regarded as undivided actions. The bottom
machine and the top machine can now be regarded as cyclic processes,
inspecting if their privilege is present and if so, doing their move, while
each normal machine can be regarded as a cyclic process that investigates the
presence of its two possible privileges alternatingly and upon finding a
privilege will do the corresponding move before investigating the presence
of its other privilege.
<p>The analysis is simplified by the fact that inspection for the presence
of a privilege implies only one neighbour and &mdash;if the privilege is present&mdash;
the move is then a completely private affair.
<p>If a normal machine nr.i enjoys two privileges, simultaneous execution
of the two possible moves would lead to conflicting assignments to up[i]
but this conflict is prevented from arising by the postulated sequential
nature of the normal machines.
<p>Simultaneous moves by two different non-neighbouring machines cannot
interact at all and we are therefore left with the analysis of simultaneous
moves by two neighbours.
<p>If machine nr.i observes a privilege from below and machine nr.i+1
a privilege from above, no common states are involved and the net result
is as if the moves were done in some order. If machine nr.i observes a
privilege from above, machine nr.i+1 can observe no privilege at all
and the question of simultaneous moves by nr.i and nr.i+1 does not arise.
We are left with the case that machine nr.i and machine nr.i+1 both observe
a privilege from below; simultaneous moves would interfere in the sense
that upon completion of the moves. machine nr.i+1 would not have lost its
privilege from below. As a matter of fact a whole sequence of machines might
simultaneously detect the privilege from below and act upon it simultaneously.
The net effect, however, is as if the moves of the sequence had been done
in order of decreasing ordinal number. As a result, even with the 
distributed demon, self-stabilization has been achieved.

<p>Finally we observe that any normal machine enjoys in the legitimate
state twice as often a privilege as the two end-machines. We can close
the ring, merging the two end-machines into a single exceptional machine:
this then is a four-state machine like the others and will enjoy a
privilege with equal frequency as all the others.

when you have a set of draughtsmen at hand; while writing it, I used the
