<p class="noindent"><b>An elephant inspired by the Dutch National Flag.</b></p>
<p>Encouraged by the success of EWD607, we now embark upon the analysis of a more intricate elephant. We start with a cyclic arrangement of 3 + 3 mosquitoes. Three main mosquitoes, called R(ed), W(hite), and B(lue) respectively, and three buffer mosquitoes RW, WB, and BR, in between:</p>
<p>R → RW → W → WB → B → BR → R .</p>
<p>The buffer mosquitoes are quite simple, e.g.:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td colspan="4">RW: <b>begin</b> <b>channel</b> W;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
<td colspan="2"><b>begin</b> <b>channel</b> R; buf: pebble;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
<td><b>do</b> R?(buf) → W!(buf) <b>od</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td colspan="2"><b>end</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
<td colspan="3"><b>end</b></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>When its (input)channel with R ceases to exist, R?(buf) will become false, and block exit will cause termination of the existence of the (output)channel with W. Each of the main mosquitoes has three “bags <b>of</b> pebble”, named “r(ed)”, “w(hite)”,and “b(lue)” . The R mosquito must collect in its bag called “r” all red pebbles in the system; its “foreign” pebbles it transmits, one at a time, via the buffer mosquito RW , first emptying its blue bag because its blue pebbles —that have to reach their destination via W — have to travel the longer distance. The arrangement is worth investigating because we expect problems with the proof of termination.</p>
<p>The solution that I am proposing has also a starting problem, but I am not going to divulge that now: I hope that that difficulty emerges “naturally” from a systematic analysis of our system.</p>

(and cyclicly).
<p>We assume that —by some magic, not to be discussed here— BR (the text of which starts with “<b>begin</b> <b>channel</b> R”) and R (the text of which starts with “<b>begin</b> <b>channel</b> BR”) perform the entry to their outer blocks simultaneously, thereby establishing the channel between them (which will be used only as an input channel to R ). when the three input channels to the main mosquitoes have been established, the six inner blocks will be entered —pairwise simultaneously, but now R paired with RW — and the output channels for the main mosquitoes have been established. (This is <b>very</b> informal and intuitive, but OK for the moment: if coded wrongly, such paired block entries can, of course, create a glorious deadlock.)</p>
<p>Let us now study mosquito R backwards. My final goal is to establish proper termination with</p>
<table width="100%">
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="10%">R0:</td>
<td>card(b) = card(w) = 0 and y-tai1(R0) is empty,</td>
</tr>
</table>
i.e. mosquito R has to terminate with red pebbles only when nothing will be sent to it anymore; with “y-tail(Ri)” I denote the sequence of y-values still to be absorbed in stage Ri before BR?(y) turns definitely false.
<p>The first step is to investigate the transition from R1 to R0 . Termination of the repetitive construct in between guarantees non BR?(y) , i.e. guarantees that y-tail(R0) is empty; infinite repetition is excluded by y-tail(R1) is finite .</p>
<p>Because card(b) = card(w) = 0 does not follow from “<b>non</b> BB” it had better hold at R1 and be kept invariant by “place”. Keeping card(w) = 0 invariant by “place” implies the absence of white pebbles in the tail, avoiding abortion implies the absence of blue ones, and we find for R1</p>
<table width="100%">
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="10%">R1:</td>
<td>card(b) = card(w) = 0 <b>and</b> y-tail(R1) is finite and red only</td>
</tr>
</table>
<b>Note</b> The condition “finite and red only” is satisfied by the empty tail. (End of’ note.)
<p>The next step is to investigate the transition from R2 to R1 . Because card(b) = 0 does not follow from “<b>non</b> BB” , we require it at R2 ; exclusion of abortion taken into account:</p>
<table width="100%">
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="10%"></td>
<td>card(b) = 0 <b>and</b> y-tail(R2) contains no blue pebbles</td>
</tr>
</table>
We have to impose more, because we have also to guarantee
<table width="100%">
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="10%"></td>
<td>card(w) = 0 <b>and</b> y-tail(R1) is finite and red only .</td>
</tr>
</table>
Termination guarantees card(w) = 0 and is guaranteed by
<table width="100%">
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="10%"></td>
<td>y-tail (R2) is finite</td>
</tr>
</table>
(For the variant function we can take: card(w) + number of white pebbles in y-tail.) But how do we guarantee that y-tail(R1) is red only?
<p>Let us define for a finite tail without blue pebbles</p>
<table width="100%">
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="45%">if tail contains no white pebbles:</td>
<td>slack = - 1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">if tail contains white pebbles 2 slack :</td>
<td>the total number of red pebbles preceding the last white one</td>
</tr>
</table>
and let us consider the relation card(w) &gt; slack ; then<br>
1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;card(w) = 0 implies that the finite tail is all red<br>
2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;card(w) &gt; slack is an invariant for the repeatable statement from R2 to R1 ; because card(w) ≥ 0 by definition, this is obvious if the resulting tail has no white pebbles, otherwise
<table width="100%">
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="10%"></td>
<td>2a) y has been white, in which case both’ card(w) and slack remained unchanged</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"></td>
<td>2b) y has been red, in which case both card(w) and slack have been decreased by 1 .</td>
</tr>
</table>
Hence, collecting all our requirements , we deduce
<table width="100%">
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="10%">R2:</td>
<td>card(b) = 0 <b>and</b> y-tail(R2) is finite, without blue pebbles <b>and</b> card(w) &gt;-slack(R2) .</td>
</tr>
</table>
For the transition from R3 to R2 , infinite repetition is excluded a priori, abortion is excluded by the absence of blue pebbles in the tail, the invariant relation that does the trick is
<table width="100%">
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="10%"></td>
<td>card(b) + card(w) &gt;-slack</td>
</tr>
</table>
and we find for R3
<table width="100%">
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="10%">R3:</td>
<td>y-tail(R3) is finite, without blue pebbles and eard(b) + card(w) &gt; slack(R3) .</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Taking the finiteness for a moment for granted, we see that<br>
1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the absence of blue pebbles in the y-tail is guaranteed (because R does not transmit red pebbles, and cyclicly)<br>
2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;slack(R3) ≥ 0 (because R does transmit blue pebbles, if any, before white ones, if any, and cyclicly.)</p>
<p>Hence, a safe starting state is: each mosquito with at least one foreign pebble! The complication at the start has, indeed, shown up nicely.</p>
<p>Termination was more easily demonstrated than originally feared.<br>
1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mosquito R will generate in its x-sequence an a priori bounded number of blue pebbles.<br>
2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same way, mosquito B will only generate in its x-sequence an a priori bounded number of white pebbles.<br>
3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equating the x-output of B with the y-input of R , we conclude that mosquito R will only receive a bounded number of white pebbles. Combining 1) and 3) we conclude that mosquito R will only generate a finite x-sequence.</p>
<p>The proof of total conservation of pebbles is left to the reader.</p>
