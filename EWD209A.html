<u>A Constructive Approach to the Problem of Program Correctness.</u>           
</P><P class="noindent">
<u>Summary</u>.
As an alternative to methods by which the correctness of given programs
can be established a posteriori, this paper proposes to control the process of
program generation such as to produce a priori correct programs. An example is
treated to show the form that such a control might then take. This example comes
from the field of parallel programming; the way in which it is treated is
representative of the way in which a whole multiprogramming system has actually
been constructed.
</p><p class="noindent"><u>1. Introduction.</u>
</p>
<p>The more ambitious we become in our machine applications, the more vital
becomes the problem of program correctness. The growing attention being paid to
this problem is therefore a quite natural and sound development. As far as I am
aware (see[1],[2],[3]), however, the problem has been tackled, posed roughly in
the following form: &ldquo;Given an algorithm and given specifications of its desired
dynamic behaviour, prove then that the dynamic behaviour of the given algorithm
meets the given specifications.&rdquo; After sufficient formalization of the way in
which the algorithm and specifications are given, we are faced with a well-posed
problem that is apparently not without mathematical appeal.
</p>
<p>
In this paper I shall tackle the problem from the other side: &ldquo;Given the
specifications of the desired dynamic behaviour, how do we derive from these
an algorithm meeting them in its dynamic behaviour?&rdquo; For certain mathematical
minds the latter problem will be less attractive (for one thing: the algorithm
to be derived is not uniquely defined by the specifications given); it seems,
however, to be of much greater practical value because, as a rule, we have to
construct the algorithm as well.
</p><p>
This paper has been written because the approach seems unusual, while we
have followed it very consciously and seem to have done so to our great advantage.
We also publish it in the hope that it may serve as a partial answer to the many
doubts evoked by our claim to have constructed a multiprogramming system of
proven flawlessness.
</p>
<p>
In this paper I shall illustrate the method by deriving an algorithm
meeting very simple specifications, whose simplicity has been chosen in order
to avoid an unnecessarily lengthy paper. In doing so I am running the risk of
readers not believing in the practicability of the method when applied to large
problems. To those I can only make the following remarks. First, that the art of
reasoning to be displayed below is faithfully representative of the way in which
we have actually designed a multiprogramming system with fairly refined management
rules. Second, that it is my firm belief that by consistent application of such
methods our ability to deal with large problems will rather increase than decrease.
Third, that to anyone who doubts the practicability of the method I can only
recommend to try to apply it. Finally, that I know only too well that I can force
no one to share my beliefs.
</p>
<p>
(The chosen problem is a synchronization problem of the type as encountered
in multiprogramming. Many of my readers will be unfamiliar with this type of
problem and the article may therefore strike them as two articles merged into
one: one dealing with multiprogramming and another dealing with the constructive
approach. This shortcoming of the paper has been pointed out to me by various
unofficial referees of its preliminary version: I agree with their criticism and
apologize to my readers. I have, however, stuck to my multiprogramming example,
for the general reader&rsquo;s unfamiliarity gives me a unique opportunity to illustrate
the approach by treating a simple example, the solution of which is not immediately
obvious to everyone. And this, I feel, illustrates the power of the approach more
convincingly than treating a traditional problem.)
</p><p class="noindent">
<u>2. The problem.</u>
</p>
<p>
For the purpose of demonstration I have chosen the following problem. We
consider two parallel, cyclic processes, called &ldquo;producer&rdquo; and &ldquo;consumer&rdquo;
respectively. They are coupled to each other via a buffer (in this example of
unlimited capacity) for &ldquo;portions&rdquo; of information. In each of its cycles the
producer puts a next portion into the buffer, in each of its cycles the consumer
takes a portion from the buffer. The buffer is allocated in the universe
surrounding the two processes; after introduction and initiation of this
universe, the two processes are started in parallel, as indicated below by the
bracket pair &ldquo;<u><kbd>parbegin</kbd></u>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<u><kbd>parend</kbd></u>&rdquo;. It is also indicated that the activity
of the producer as well as the activity of the consumer can be regarded at this
stage as an alternating succession of two actions. It is understood that the
actions labelled P1 (i.e. actual production) and E2 (i.e. actual consumption)
are the time-consuming actions (probably synchronized to other processes) of
which the possibility of parallel execution is of actual interest, while the
actions labelled P2 and C1, in which portions are transmitted into or from the
buffer (the only ones in which reference to the common buffer is made) will 
be very concise actions (some bookkeeping with pointers and links, say), the
potential parallelism of which can be discarded if desired. We depart in our
example from the (hopefully now self-explanatory) structure given below; here
the actions invoked are to be considered as available primitives.
</p><p class="noindent">
Version 0:
</p><pre>
<u>begin</u> initiate an empty buffer;
   <u>parbegin</u>
producer: <u>begin</u> local initiation of the producer;
            P1: produce next portion locally;
            P2: transmit portion into the buffer;
            <u>goto</u> P1
          <u>end</u>;
consumer: <u>begin</u> local initiation of the consumer;
            C1: transmit portion from buffer;
            C2: consume new portion locally;
            <u>goto</u> C1
          <u>end</u>
   <u>parend</u>
<u>end</u></pre>
<p>
For the proper co-operation of the two processes as described above we must
assume an implicit synchronization, preventing the consumer to try to take a
portion from an empty buffer. In the following we shall refuse to make any
assumptions about the speed ratio of the two processes and our task is to program
the synchronization between the two processes explicitly. (The synchronizing
primitives I intend to use for this solution will be described in due time.)
</p>
<p>
<u>Note</u>. For brevity I omit the proof although for this simple example not
too difficult&mdash; that the above problem is well-posed in the sense that a
synchronization satisfying the above requirement does not contain the danger of
the so-called "deadly embrace", i.e. one or more processes getting irrevocably
stuck because they are waiting for each other. I do so because this proof is
more concerned with the problem as posed than with the task of programming it
and the latter is the true subject of this paper.
</p><p class="noindent">
<u>3. Formalization of the required dynamic behaviour.</u></u>
</p>
<p>
Our first step is the introduction of suitable variables in terms of which
we can give a more formal description of the specification of the required
dynamic behaviour. As stated, the consumer should behave in such a way that it
does not try to take a portion from an empty buffer. The first question is: how
do we keep track of its emptyness? As a result of transmitting a portion into
the buffer, the buffer becomes non-empty, as a result of transmitting a portion
from the buffer the latter only becomes empty if its last and only portion has
been taken from it. In other words, we can keep track of its emptyness (i.e.
the buffer contains zero portions) provided that we can answer the
question whether the (non-empty) buffer contains exactly 1 portion. Repeating
the argument we conclude that the number of portions in the buffer is a vital
quantity. Therefore we introduce an integer variable, &ldquo;<kbd>n</kbd>&rdquo; say, whose value has
to equal the number of portions in the buffer. The rule to be followed this time
is particularly simple: first, initiate the value of &ldquo;<kbd>n</kbd>&rdquo; together with the
initiation of the buffer, so that the relation
<p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tr>
    <td width="8%">&nbsp;</td>
    <td width="86%"><pre>"<var>n</var> = number of portions in the buffer"</pre></td>
    <td width="6%" align="right">(1)</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p class="noindent">is satisfied to start with. From then onwards, adjust the value of the variable
  called &ldquo;<kbd>n</kbd>&rdquo; whenever the number of portions in the buffer is changed, i.e. when
  transmitting a portion into it or from it. As a result the relation (1) will be
always satisfied.</p>
<p>From now onwards the three actions initiating or changing the buffer
  contents are regarded as actions including the proper operation on the variable
called &ldquo;<kbd>n</kbd>&rdquo;. To indicate this, we may write Version 1: </p>
<pre>
<u>begin</u> <u>integer</u> n;
       initiate an empty buffer including "n:= 0";
  <u>parbegin</u>
producer: <u>begin</u> local initiation of the producer;
           P1: produce next portion locally; 
           P2: transmit portion into the buffer including "n:= n + 1";
               <u>goto</u> P1
          <u>end</u>;
consumer: <u>begin</u> local initiation of the consumer;
           C1: transmit portion from buffer including "n:=n - 1";
           C2: consume new portion locally;
               <u>goto</u> C1                                     
          <u>end</u>
  <u>parend</u>
<u>end</u></pre><p>
Thus we have achieved that the specification of the dynamic behaviour can
be formulated by the requirement that the inequality
<p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td><pre>n &ge; 0</pre></td>
    <td align="right">(2)</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p class="noindent">
will always be satisfied.
</p><p>
(<u>Remark</u>. It may well be, that already in the transition from the original
Version 0 to Version 1 we can observe one of the origins of the efficiency of
the constructive approach. If we had regarded the Version 1 as given but in
addition to this wanted to identify the current value of <kbd>n</kbd> with the current
number of portions in the buffer, we would have to observe its initiation and
its adjustments, but in excess to this we would have to read the whole program
in order to verify that no other operations on it can occur, while we, however,
exploit the given fact that the actions labelled P1 and C2 by definition do not
refer to the buffer.) </p><p class="noindent">
<u>4. Analysis of the formalized requirements.</u>
</p><p>
We now proceed from Version 1 and requirement (2). The latter requirement
is satisfied initially; we have only to synchronize the two processes in such a
way that it <em>remains</em> satisfied. </p><p>
From the fact that requirement (2) concerns the value of the variable called
"<kbd>n</kbd>" only, it follows that the processes can only cause violation by acting on
this variable, i.e. only via the actions labelled "P2" and "C1" respectively.
Closer inspection of the requirement ("<kbd>n &ge; 0</kbd>") and the actions shows that the
action labelled "P2" (including "<kbd>n:= n + 1</kbd>") is quite harmless, because
<pre>               n &ge; 0 implies   n+1 &ge; 0    , </pre>
but that the action labelled "C1" (including "<kbd>n:= n - 1</kbd>") may indeed cause a
violation. More precisely, as
<pre>               n &ge; 1 implies n-1 &ge; 0  , </pre>
<p class="noindent">the action labelled "C1" is harmless when initiated when</p>
<p class="noindent">
<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td><pre>n &ge; 1</pre></td>
    <td align="right">(3)</td>
  </tr>
</table></p>
<p class="noindent">
while when n = 0 it would cause violation; under the latter circumstance it has
to be postponed.
</p>
</p>
<p>
(<u>Remark</u>. Our last conclusion is, that the only possible harm is trying to
make the buffer more empty than empty. Its obviousness here is a direct consequence
of the simplicity of this example. The point is, that this conclusion could be
reached by inspection of the formalized requirement (2) and the operations on
the variables concerned. In the case of a more refined management, the
requirements analogous to (2) are no longer a simple inequality and their
analysis will really tell you all the danger points.) </p><p class="noindent">
<u>5. Consequence of the preceding analysis; the unstable situation.</u>
</p><p>
In the previous section we have concluded that the action labelled "C1" is
the only danger point. Having here only one consumer, we could have solved the
problem logically by inserting just in front of it a wait cycle
<pre>     "C0: <u>if</u> n = O <u>then</u> <u>goto</u> C0"  </pre>
but we refused to implement this busy form of waiting, because in a multiprogrammed
environment it seems a waste to spend central processor time on a process that
has already established that for the time being it cannot go on; furthermore
this solution does not admit a straightforward generalization to, say, more
consumers.. Therefore we have implemented means &mdash;viz. the synchronizing primitives&mdash;
by which a process can go to sleep until further notice (a sleeping process
being by definition no candidate for processor time), leaving of course to the
other processes the obligation to give this &ldquo;further notice&rdquo; in due time. This
is so closely analogous to usual optimizing techniques that I proceed with this
multiprogramming example in full confidence that the uniprogrammer will be able
to apply similar considerations to his own tasks.
</p>
<p>
We see ourselves faced with the decision whether the action labelled &ldquo;C1&rdquo; should take place or not. Earlier we have seen that this decision depends on the
current value of the variable called &ldquo;n&rdquo;. Recently we have seen that under
certain circumstances we refuse to regard this as a private decision of the
consumer (this would imply the busy form of waiting) but wish to delegate it
(via the mechanism of the further notice) to the producer. As long as it was a
private decision of the consumer, inserting it at the right place in the
consumer&rsquo;s text was a sufficient means to ensure that the decision was taken
in accordance with the dynamic progress of the consumer. As soon as this decision
might be taken by another process &mdash;in this example by the producer&mdash; the dynamic
progress of the consumer becomes a question of general interest, in particular
whether the consumer is ready for the next action labelled C1. We introduce a
boolean variable, called &ldquo;hungry&rdquo; whose value has to indicate explicitly that
the consumer's progress has reached the stage that the decision to execute or
to postpone the action labelled &ldquo;C1&rdquo; is relevant.
</p>
<p>
To ensure that the variable called &ldquo;<kbd>hungry</kbd>&rdquo; has this meaning, we must
<br>
1) insert within the consumer's cycle the assignment &ldquo;<kbd>hungry:= <u>true</u></kbd>&rdquo; just
in front of the statement labelled &ldquo;C1&rdquo;;
<br>
2) include the assignment &ldquo;<kbd>hungry:= <u>false</u></kbd>&rdquo; as part of the action labelled &ldquo;C1&rdquo;;
<br>
3) initiate in the universe the variable called &ldquo;<kbd>hungry</kbd>&rdquo; in accordance with
the starting point in the consumer&rsquo;s cycle.
</p>
<p>
The variable called &ldquo;<kbd>hungry</kbd>&rdquo; is an explicit coding of the consumer&rsquo;s
progress, analogous to the variable called &ldquo;<kbd>n</kbd>&rdquo;, introduced as an explicit
coding of the number of portions in the buffer. We arrive at Version 2:
<pre>
<u>begin</u> <u>integer</u> n; <u>Boolean</u> hungry;
      initiate an empty buffer including "n:= 0";
      hungry := <u>false</u>;
   <u>parbegin</u>
producer: <u>begin</u> local initiation of the producer;
            P1: produce next portion locally;
            P2: transmit portion into the buffer including "n:= n + 1";
                <u>goto</u> P1
          <u>end</u>;
consumer: <u>begin</u> local initiation of the consumer;
            C0: hungry:= <u>true</u>;
            C1: transmit portion from buffer including "n:= n  1" and
                                 "hungry:= <u>false</u>";
            C2: consume new portion locally;
                <u>goto</u> C0
          <u>end</u>
   <u>parend</u>
<u>end</u></pre>
<p>
From relation (3) and the meaning of the variable called &ldquo;<kbd>hungry</kbd>&rdquo; we now
deduce that the action labelled &ldquo;C1&rdquo; should take place whenever
<p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tr>
    <td width="13%">&nbsp;</td>
    <td width="75%"><pre>n &ge; 1 <u>and</u> hungry</pre></td>
    <td width="12%" align="right">(4)</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p class="noindent">becomes <u>true</u>, the action labelled &ldquo;C1&rdquo; itself causing (4) to become <u>false</u> again.
  In other words: we must see to it that (4) characterizes what we could call
  &ldquo;an unstable situation&rdquo;, for as soon as it emerges it should be resolved by the
  action labelled &ldquo;C1&rdquo;.
  </p>
</p>
<p>
  Having no permanently active observer that will give alarm whenever the
  unstable situation arises, we must allocate the inspection for the unstable
  situation (and, if found, its subsequent resolution by action &ldquo;C1&rdquo;) somewhere
  in the sequential processes. The necessary and sufficient measure is to attach
  this inspection as an appendix to each action that may have generated the
  unstable situation from a stable one, thus pinning the responsibility to
  resolve the unstable situation down to the process that has generated it.
</p>
<p>
Some elementary logic applied to (4) tells us that this transition can
only be effected by an action assigning the value <u>true</u> to the variable called
&ldquo;hungry&rdquo; or by an action increasing the value of the variable called &ldquo;<kbd>n</kbd>&rdquo; (or
by an action doing both, not occurring in this example). In terms of Version 2:
the instability may be reached as a result of the action labelled &ldquo;C0&rdquo; (on
account of &ldquo;<kbd>hungry:= <u>true</u></kbd>&rdquo;) and of the action labelled &ldquo;P2&rdquo; (on account of
&ldquo;<kbd>n := n + 1</kbd>&rdquo;). So the action labelled &ldquo;P2&rdquo; &mdash;allocated in the producer&mdash; might get
attached to it as a appendix the action labelled &ldquo;C1&rdquo;, originally allocated in
consumer!
</p><p class="noindent">
<u>6. Interlude on synchronizinq primitives.</u>
</p><p>
At this stage of the discussion we must insert an interlude that has nothing
to do with this particular problem, nor with the main train of thought of this
paper The interlude has been inserted because I expect many a reader to be
unfamiliar with the basic problems of programming parallel processes, the field
from which our example happens to have been taken.
</p><p>
We need primitives to control that processes may go to sleep or may be
woken up. For this purpose we introduce
<br>
1) special purpose binary valued variables, called &ldquo;semaphores&rdquo;. A semaphore
may have the values 0 and 1. Semaphores are allocated in the surrounding
universe and are initiated before the parallel processes are started. (Semaphores
can be (and have been) generalized from two-valued quantities to non-negative
integers. In this article we do not do so, for our example is so simple that
the generalized semaphore would provide a ready made solution!)
<br>2) two special operations, called the P- and the V-operation respectively.
The parallel processes shall access the semaphores via these operations only.
</p>
<p>
The P-operation on a semaphore can only be completed at a moment that the
semaphore value equals 1. Its completion implies that the semaphore value is
reset to 0. If a process initiates a P-operation on a semaphore with at that
moment a value equal to 0, &ldquo;the process goes to sleep, the P-operation remains
pending on this semaphore&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>
The V-operation on a semaphore is only defined if its initial value equals 0.
It will then set the semaphore to 1. If no P-operation is pending on this semaphore
the V-operation has no further effect. If one or more P-operations are pending on
it, the V-operation will have the further effect that exactly one of the pending
P-operations will be completed (thereby resetting the semaphore to the value 0),
i.e. the process in which this P-operation occurred is woken up again.
</p>
<p>
As a result a semaphore value equal to 1 implies that there are at that
moment no P-operations pending on it.
</p><p>
The semaphores are used for two entirely distinct purposes; both standard
usages will occur in the example.
</p>
<p>
On the one hand we have the so-called &ldquo;private semaphores&rdquo;, each belonging
to a specific sequential process, that will be the only one to perform a P-operation
on it, viz. where the process might need to be delayed until some event has
occurred: the semaphore values 0 and 1 at the initiation of the P-operation
represent the situation that the event in question has not yet or has already
occurred. As a rule the universe initiates private semaphores with the value 0.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand we have the semaphore(s) used for the implementation of
so-called &ldquo;critical sections&rdquo;, the executions of which have to exclude each other
in time. Such critical sections can be implemented by opening them with a
P-operation and closing them with a V-operation, all on the same semaphore with
initial value 1. At each moment the value of such a semaphore for mutual exclusion
equals the number of processes allowed to enter a section critical to it. The
purpose of critical sections is to cater for unambiguous modification and
interpretation of universal variables (such as &ldquo;<kbd>n</kbd>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<kbd>hungry</kbd>&rdquo; in our example). </p>
<p>
Alternatively: at a certain level of abstraction we can visualize a single
sequential process as a succession of &ldquo;immediate actions&rdquo;; the time taken to
perform them is logically immaterial, only the states (as given by the values of
the variables) observable in between the actions have on that level a logical
significance. It is only when we shift to a lower level of abstraction and
implement the actions themselves by means of (smaller) sequential sub-processes
that the intermediate states as well as their periods of execution enter the
picture. And it is only at this lower level that &ldquo;mutual exclusion in time&rdquo; has
a significance. In a single sequential process successive actions (now regarded
as sub-processes) exclude each other in time automatically, because the next one
will only be initiated after the preceding one has been completed. In
multiprogramming the mutual exclusion at the lower level of abstraction is no
longer automatically guaranteed and the fact that on the higher level we regard
them as single &ldquo;immediate actions&rdquo; requires then explicit recognition. This is
exactly what the critical sections cater for.
</p><p class="noindent">
<u>7. Resolution of the unstable situation and synchronization of the processes.</u>
</p>
<p>
Our analysis of the unstable situation ended with the conclusion that the
action labelled &ldquo;C1&rdquo;, originally allocated in the consumer, will be attached
as a conditional appendix to the actions labelled &ldquo;C0&rdquo; and &ldquo;P2&rdquo; respectively,to
the ones that might generate the unstable situation.
</p>
<p>
To pin the responsibility for the resolution of the unstable situation
down to the process that has generated it, the latter one must be uniquely
defined (which is not the case if the effective assignments &ldquo;<kbd>n:= 1</kbd>&rdquo; as part of
P2 and &ldquo;<kbd>hungry:= <u>true</u></kbd>&rdquo; as part of C0 are allowed to take place simultaneously)
and it must have resolved the unstable situation before the other process may
have discovered it. In other words, creation of the unstable situation and its
subsequent resolution must be regarded as a single &ldquo;immediate action&rdquo; in the
sense of the last paragraph of the interlude. We shall implement them by critical
sections controlled by a semaphore, &ldquo;mutex&rdquo; say, that will be initiated with the
value 1.
</p>
<p>
Finally, in Version 2 the sequential nature of the consumer guaranteed that
execution of the action labelled &ldquo;C2&rdquo; would be preceded by one execution of
action labelled &ldquo;C1&rdquo;. This implicit sequencing can be made explicit with the
aid of a private semaphore of the consumer, &ldquo;consem&rdquo; say, (to be initiated with
the value 0) by concluding the action labelled &ldquo;C1&rdquo; with &ldquo;<kbd>V(consem)</kbd>&rdquo; and opening
the action labelled &ldquo;C2&rdquo; with <kbd>&ldquo;P(consem</kbd>)&rdquo;. The sequencing has to be made explicit
because the action labelled &ldquo;C1&rdquo; may now occur as an activity of the producer.
</p>
<p>
After these considerations the final version of the program is given. For
reasons of clarity and economy (of writing and thinking) the action labelled
&ldquo;C1&rdquo; has been included in the body of a procedure declared in the universe.
</p><p>
<u>Note 1</u>. The program given below does not pretend to be the only, or the
best or the most economical solution. It pretends to be a correct solution. It is
general in the sense that more complicated similar problems can be solved along
the same pattern.
</p><p>
<u>Note 2</u>. As announced (in section 2) the potential parallelism of the action
"transmit portion into the buffer" and "transmit portion from buffer" would
would be discarded if desired. This indeed has happened, as the actions only
occur within critical sections. The generalization to more producers, more
consuners etc. is now straightforward.
</p><p>
<u>Note 3</u>. The step from Version 2 to the Final Version is rather large: for
various unofficial referees of the preliminary version of this paper the Final
Version still came straight from "The Magician's Box". I can understand their
feelings, I have not succeeded in remedying the situation, "in buffering the
shack of invention".

The above is as faithful a reproduction as I can give ot the kind of reasoning
we applied in the construction of a multiprogramming system, albeit interlaced
with explanatory paragraphs, covering
the insights we had already gained at an
earlier stage by just thinking about the problems involved in the programming
of parallel processes. At the end, when we were all familiar with this type of
problem, the reasoning needed to derive the program from specifications much
more complicated than the present example, used to be given on a single page or
less.

<u>8. Concluding remarks.</u>
</p><p>
First, one can remark that I have      not done much more than to make explicit
what the sure and competent programmer has already done for years, be it mostly
intuitively and unconsciously. I admit so, but without any shame: making his
behaviour conscious and explicit seems a relevant step in the process of transforming
the Art of Programming into the Science of Programming. My point is that this
reasoning can and should be done explicitly.
</p>
<p>
Second, I should like to stress that by using the verb &ldquo;to derive&rdquo; I do
not intend to suggest any form of automatism, nor to underestimate the amount of
mathematical invention involved in all non-trivial programming (On the contrary!)
But I do suggest the constructive approach sketched in this paper as an
accompanying justification of his inventions, as a tool to check during the
process of invention that he is not being lead astray, as a reliable and inspiring
guide.
</p><p>
Third, I am fully aware that the style of reasoning I have applied, though
possibly appealing to some, might easily appal others. For this difference in
taste I blame them as little as they should blame me. I can only hope that they
will find a way to follow the constructive approach in a style satisfactory to
them.
</p><p>
Finally, I should like to point out that the constructive approach to
program correctness sheds some new light on the debugging problem. Personally
I cannot refrain from feeling that many debugging aids that are en vogue now
are invented as a compensation for the shortcomings of a programming technique
that will be denounced as obsolete within the near future.
</p><p class="noindent"><u>Acknowledgements.</u>
</p><p>
Acknowledgements are due to my closest collaborators C.Bron, A.N.Habermann,
F.J.A.Hendriks, E.Ligtmans and P.A.Voorhoeve, for by working in the way they did,
convinced me of the practicability of the constructive approach when faced
with a large problem.                  
</p>
<p>
Acknowledgements are also due &mdash;although they may be unaware of the fact to   
Peter Naur and my colleague Gerhard W.Veltkamp. To the former because he convinced
that something should and could be done regarding program correctness, to the
latter for his inspiring faith in my efforts, his patience when listening to me
and his unrelenting, pityless criticism whenever I indulged in disguising
sloppy reasoning by means of a verbal show.
