<h2>Visuals for BP's Venture Research Conference</h2>
<ul>
<li>When we had no computers, we had no programming problem either.</li>
<li>When we had a few computers, we had a mild programming problem.</li>
<li>Confronted with machines a million times as powerful, we are faced with a gigantic programming problem.</li>
<li>The programming problem is gigantic because
<ol type="i">
<li type="i">viewed as string of operations on a collection of variables, each individual computation is a gigantic object;</li>
<li type="i">the individual computation depending on the input, a single program has to be able to control a gigantic number of different possible computations.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>As a result, programming has become one of our most demanding intellectual activities, requiring great clarity of expression and the utmost economy of reasoning.</li>
<li>This conclusion has never been refuted; it is, however, regularly denied because of its uncomfortable implications.</li>
<li>It is vigorously denied by the computer industry, which would sell you its products rather as solutions to your old problems than as the source of terrifying new ones.</li>
<li>It is vigorously denied by those customers that otherwise would have to admit that their computer manufacturer has fooled them.</li>
<li>[Remember that computers are preferably sold by dealing with such a high level of the customer's hierarchy that incompetence in computing is assured and objections from the technically competent can be overruled.]</li>
<li>It is vigorously denied by those in computing that by its implications would be demoted to the rank of amateur.</li>
<li>[Remember: the surest way of making software design prohibitively expensive is viewing it as a production job to be done by cheap labour.]</li>
<li>It is denied in those companies whose top management consists of lawyers and accountants, as their management lore has all its roots predating the advent of the high-technology industry.</li>
<li>It is also denied by the personal-computer enthusiast that fails to distinguish between a barber and a team of surgeons.</li>
<li>Back to the irrefuted conclusion that programming is very difficult; its acceptance gave rise to Programming Methodology as a topic of explicit scientific concern.</li>
<li>In 15 years of Programming Methodology we have seen the combination of spectacular progress and sharp limitations.</li>
<li>Many formerly notoriously opaque algorithms now have "ingeniously simple and effective" explanations, which are jewels of clarity.</li>
<li>Sophisticated new algorithms are being derived which, 15 years ago, would have been absolutely impossible to conceive. But.....</li>
<li>Current mathematical style —which grew in response to other challenges— limits the applicability to relatively small programs.</li>
<li>The circumstances shaping the challenge, we try to redefine Mathematics from "The abstract science of space, number, and quantity" (<acronym>COD</acronym>) to "The (art and) science of effective reasoning".</li>
<li>We have learnt that calculi of all sorts have a major role to play.</li>
<li>We have learnt that it pays to design, for each calculus to be used, with great care a notation geared to one's manipulative needs.</li>
<li>We have learnt that most philosophers (those of mathematics included) are eminently ignorable.</li>
<li>We have learnt that a formalism's major purpose can be to free us from the shackles of our native language and the reasoning patterns induced thereby.</li>
<li>[Being "counter-intuitive" should not be held against any formalism that enables us to accomplish what is beyond the unaided mind.]</li>
<li>We have learnt that programming methodology and mathematical methodology in general are not so far apart at all. (For instance, a conscious separation of concerns is equally valuable for both.)</li>
<li>We have learnt that a purely syntactic analysis of the formal requirement can give heuristic guidance to the point of generating the best possible solution.</li>
<li>We have learnt that the potential for improvement can be dramatic, e.g. reducing a formal proof of two dozen steps to an equally formal proof of one step.
<p align="center">(Example.)</p>
</li>
<li>We have learnt that it pays to be ruthlessly pragmatic, but.....</li>
<li>We have also learnt that it is still very hard to sell to industry the economic value of mathematical elegance.
