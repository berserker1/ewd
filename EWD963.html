<H2>Visuals for BP's Venture Research Conference</h2>
		<ul>
<li>When we had no computers, we had no programming problem either.</li> 

<li>When we had a few computers, we had a mild programming problem.</li> 

<li>Confronted with machines a million times as powerful, we are faced with a gigantic programming problem.</li>
			<li>The programming problem is gigantic because

			<ol type="i">
				<li type="i">viewed as string of operations on a collection of variables, each individual computation is a gigantic object;
				<li type="i">the individual computation depending on the input, a single program has to be able to control a gigantic number of different possible computations.
			</ol>
			<li>As a result, programming has become one of our most demanding intellectual activities, requiring great clarity of expression and the utmost economy of reasoning.
			<li>This conclusion has never been refuted; it is, however, regularly denied because of its uncomfortable implications.
			<li>It is vigorously denied by the computer industry, which would sell you its products rather as solutions to your old problems than as the source of terrifying new ones.
			<li>It is vigorously denied by those customers that otherwise would have to admit that their computer manufacturer has fooled them.
			<li>[Remember that computers are preferably sold by dealing with such a high level of the customer's hierarchy that incompetence in computing is assured and objections from the technically competent can be overruled.]
			<li>It is vigorously denied by those in computing that by its implications would be demoted to the rank of amateur.
			<li>[Remember: the surest way of making software design prohibitively expensive is viewing it as a production job to be done by cheap labour.]
			<li>It is denied in those companies whose top management consists of lawyers and accountants, as their management lore has all its roots predating the advent of the high-technology industry.
			<li>It is also denied by the personal-computer enthusiast that fails to distinguish between a barber and a team of surgeons.
			<li>Back to the irrefuted conclusion that programming is very difficult; its acceptance gave rise to Programming Methodology as a topic of explicit scientific concern.
			<li>In 15 years of Programming Methodology we have seen the combination of spectacular progress and sharp limitations.
			<li>Many formerly notoriously opaque algorithms now have &quot;ingeniously simple and effective&quot; explanations, which are jewels of clarity.
			<li>Sophisticated new algorithms are being derived which, 15 years ago, would have been absolutely impossible to conceive. But.....
			<li>Current mathematical style &#x2014;which grew in response to other challenges&#x2014; limits the applicability to relatively small programs.
			<li>The circumstances shaping the challenge, we try to redefine Mathematics from &quot;The abstract science of space, number, and quantity&quot; (<acronym>COD</acronym>) to &quot;The (art and) science of effective reasoning&quot;.
			<li>We have learnt that calculi of all sorts have a major role to play.
			<li>We have learnt that it pays to design, for each calculus to be used, with great care a notation geared to one's manipulative needs.
			<li>We have learnt that most philosophers (those of mathematics included) are eminently ignorable.
			<li>We have learnt that a formalism's major purpose can be to free us from the shackles of our native language and the reasoning patterns induced thereby.
			<li>[Being &quot;counter-intuitive&quot; should not be held against any formalism that enables us to accomplish what is beyond the unaided mind.]
			<li>We have learnt that programming methodology and mathematical methodology in general are not so far apart at all. (For instance, a conscious separation of concerns is equally valuable for both.)
			<li>We have learnt that a purely syntactic analysis of the formal requirement can give heuristic guidance to the point of generating the best possible solution.
			<li>We have learnt that the potential for improvement can be dramatic, e.g. reducing a formal proof of two dozen steps to an equally formal proof of one step.
			<p align=center>(Example.)</p>
			<li>We have learnt that it pays to be ruthlessly pragmatic, but.....
			<li>We have also learnt that it is still very hard to sell to industry the economic value of mathematical elegance.
