<u>Parallellism in multi-record transactions.</u>
<p>      by E.W.Dijkstra and E.S.Scholten
<p>      We consider a data base comprising a great number of individual records
and transactions to be carried out on this data base. Each transaction is a
finite computation, involving a number of these records: the computation to
be carried out —and even the identity of the records involved&mdash; will in
general be dependent on the initial state of the data base when the transaction
is initiated. When the data base grows, the following conflict emerges: on
the one hand one may expect the number of transactions to be carried out to
grow as well, on the other hand the growing data base will make individual
record selection a more and more painful process, slowing down the individual
transaction executions. Comes the moment that the stream of transactions,
carried out one after the other, no longer fits in real time. To solve this
real time problem we must be willing to carry out a number of transactions
in parallel. This paper is devoted to the logical problems that then emerge.
<p>      The purpose of this paper is twofold: firstly to isolate (and to solve
to a certain extent) the logical problems involved and secondly, to demonstrate
the viability of our top-down approach in problem solving. This means that those
readers that are unfamiliar with the top-down approach but are familiar with
a number of these logical problems, must be patient. If they find us ignoring
a number of practical considerations in the beginning, they should read on
quietly: there is a fair chance that they will be taken into account in due
time.
<p class="noindent"><b>The first model.</b>
<p>      In the purely sequential execution of the transactions, we can execute the
transactions in the (supposedly unique) order in which they are requested and
at any moment in time there is at most one transaction under execution. In
our first model, we still assume that the requests for transactions reach the
system in a unique order and with a speed regulated by the system in such a
way that the system can cope with the requests. We admit, however, that at
any moment in time the number of transactions currently under execution may
be larger than one, although not exceeding some given finite upper bound. The
execution of a transaction extends from the moment that the system has acknowledged
the request for the transaction until the moment that the system has completed
the transaction.
<p>      In the purely sequential execution, the system&rsquo;s net reaction to a number
of transaction requests may depend on the order in which the transactions are
requested. In the case of parallellism we do <em>not</em> require that the system&rsquo;s net
reaction is identical to that of the sequential system when faced with the
stream of requests in the order in which the parallel system has acknowledged
these requests. We do require, however, that it is possible to order the requests
in such a way that the net reaction of the sequential system faced with the
requests in that order will be identical to the reaction of the parallel system.
(In many cases, viz. when we have two mutually non-interfering transactions,
this order need not be unique.)
<p>      Our parallel system has three main obligations; it has to prevent
1) undesired interference, 2) deadlock and 3) individual starvation.
<p class="noindent"><b>ad 1.</b>
<p>We assume each transaction identified only for the period of its execution.
        Let <var>T</var>[<var>i</var>] be a transaction currently under execution, let <var>M</var>[<var>i</var>] be the set of
        records manipulated up till now by <var>T</var>[<var>i</var>]. This implies that during the execution
        of <var>T</var>[<var>i</var>], the set <var>M</var>[<var>i</var>] can never decrease, until transaction <var>T</var>[<var>i</var>] is terminated and
        <var>M</var>[<var>i</var>] ceases to exist. We can guarantee the absence of undesirable interference
when at any moment in time
<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

      <p><var>i</var> &ne; <var>j</var><span class="noindent"> &rArr; </span><var>M</var>[<var>i</var>] &cap; <var>M</var>[<var>j</var>] = &#8709;</p>

<p class="noindent">i.e. for two different transactions the intersection of the corresponding sets
  <var>M</var> is empty.
<p class="noindent"><b>ad 2.</b>
<p>If <var>a</var> and <var>b</var> are two different records and for <var>i</var> &ne; <var>j</var> we have at a given moment
  <var>a</var> &isin; <var>M</var>[<var>i</var>]      and      <var>b</var> &isin; <var>M</var>[<var>j</var>]
  then we will find ourselves in trouble when the progress of <var>T</var>[<var>i</var>] requires
  record <var>b</var> to be added to <var>M</var>[<var>i</var>] and also the progress of <var>T</var>[<var>j</var>] requires record <var>a</var> to be added to <var>M</var>[<var>j</var>], for then there is no way in which <var>T</var>[<var>i</var>] or <var>T</var>[<var>j</var>] can progress
  without violating condition 1. This is called &ldquo;deadlock&rdquo;. If we insist on the
  absence of the danger of deadlock &mdash;and we do&mdash; the above observation tells us
  that without any further knowledge about the future requirements of the transactions,
  parallellism is impossible. We therefore associate with each transaction <var>T</var>[<var>i</var>]
  a set <var>F</var>[<var>i</var>] of records, containing all the records that may possibly be added
  to <var>M</var>[<var>i</var>]. (Note that this definition implies <var>M</var>[<var>i</var>] &cap; <var>F</var>[<var>i</var>] = &#8709;.)
<p>      When the current transactions can be renumbered such that

  <tr>
    <td><blockquote>
      <p><span class="noindent"><var>i</var> &lt; <var>j</var> &rArr; <var>F</var>[<var>i</var>] &cap; <var>M</var>[<var>j</var>] = &#8709;</span></p>
    </blockquote></td>
    <td align="right"><p>2)</p></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p class="noindent">the danger of deadlock is absent, for then <var>T</var>[0] can be carried to completion
          and after that the new <var>T</var>[0] etc. We call the situation &ldquo;safe&rdquo; when besides relation 1 the 
          current transactions can be renumbered such that relation 2 holds. We shall keep the
          system in a safe state. From the above we can conclude that decrease of the
          set <var>F</var>[<var>i</var>] &mdash;as a result of progress of <var>T</var>[<var>i</var>]&mdash; will leave a safe situation safe; it
          furthermore follows that such a decrease is something to be encouraged, because
          as long as <var>F</var>[0] = the universe, all <var>M</var>[<var>j</var>] with <var>j</var> > 0 must be empty, i.e.
          parallellism is not possible.
<p>      When we start each transaction with its <var>F</var> equal to the universe and insist
that <var>T</var>[<var>i</var>] can only add a record to <var>M</var>[<var>i</var>] by transferring it from <var>F</var>[<var>i</var>], then this
is the only transition that might violate condition 1 or the safety, i.e.
this is the only place where it might be necessary to hold up the further execution
of the transaction, &ldquo;to put the transaction to sleep.&rdquo; The &ldquo;counter-occurrences,&rdquo;
on account of which a sleeping transaction could be woken up again are 
when another processing transaction decreases its own <var>F</var> explicitly or
terminates.
<p>      In the above we have assumed that for each transaction, <var>F</var> would start
equal to the universe and would only decrease. Because this set is so huge,
one could think that it could be profitable to divide the execution of a
transaction into two successive phases, a first phase in which <var>F</var> is still
allowed to grow and a second phase in which this is no longer permissible. But
as far as the avoidance of deadlock is concerned, such a transaction is
equivalent to one with <var>F</var> equal to the universe during the first phase, decreasing
<var>F</var> to the stated amount upon the transition from the first to the second phase.
<p class="noindent"><b>ad 3.
</b>
<p>Our system has to allocate records to transitions. When the allocation
  strategy is such that each request of a <var>F</var> &rarr; <var>M</var> transition is honoured as soon as
  this is compatible with the simultaneity restriction 1 and the safety condition,
  it is well-known that the execution of an acknowledged transaction may be postponed 
indefinitely long. If we have

<table width="56%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tr>
    <td valign="middle"><p><var>M</var>[1] = {<var>a</var>}</p></td>
    <td valign="middle"><p><var>F</var>[1] = {<var>c</var>}</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="middle"><p><var>M</var>[2] = {<var>b</var>}</p></td>
    <td valign="middle"><p><var>F</var>[2] = {<var>c</var>}</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="middle"><p><var>M</var>[3] = &#8709;</p></td>
    <td valign="middle"><p><var>F</var>[3] = {<var>a</var>, <var>b</var>, <var>c</var>}</p></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p class="noindent">and suppose that <var>T</var>[3] would like to transfer record <var>c</var> to <var>M</var>[3], then it cannot
  do so because otherwise the deadlock danger woul be introduced with respect
  to both <var>T</var>[1] and <var>T</var>[2]. In the case of an infinite supply of transactions of
  type 1 and type 2, <var>T</var>[3] could be kept asleep forever. This phenomenon is called
  individual starvation and as a rule it is considered to be undesirable.
<p>      A crude way to exorcize the danger of individual starvation is the following:
As soon as a transaction is put to sleep, a fixed upper limit is imposed upon
the number of transactions that may be initiated during that nap. We are not
going to look for a more refined technique now, for there are other reasons why
we consider our first model as too crude, and in our second model we shall
depart from it.
<p class="noindent"><b>The second model.</b>
<p>      Our main complaint about the first model is that a record once in set
  <var>M</var>[<var>i</var>] remains in set <var>M</var>[<var>i</var>] until the transaction has run to completion. We would
like to be able to express that a transaction is such that a manipulated
record is no longer essential for the correct progress of the transaction.
We therefore split <var>M</var>[<var>i</var>] into two disjoint sets <var>A</var>[<var>i</var>] and <var>P</var>[<var>i</var>], i.e. the
records that are still active and the records that have been processed. A
record in set <var>P</var>[<var>i</var>] has arrived there from set <var>F</var>[<var>i</var>] via set <var>A</var>[<var>i</var>] and will
remain there until termination of <var>T</var>[<var>i</var>].
<p>      Obviously
<p> <var>i</var> &ne; <var>j</var> &rArr;   <var>A</var>[<var>i</var>] &cap; <var>A</var>[<var>j</var>] = &#8709; 
<p class="noindent">is a necessary condition, but this is no longer sufficient to guarantee that
  the net reaction of the parallel system is identical to the reaction of a
  sequential system after proper ordering of the requests, for it would not
  exclude
<p><var>A</var>[<var>i</var>] &cap; <var>P</var>[<var>j</var>] &ne; &#8709; <b>and</b>   <var>A</var>[<var>j</var>] &cap; <var>P</var>[<var>i</var>] &ne; &#8709;    . 
<p class="noindent">The first condition expresses that in the sequential ordering <var>T</var>[<var>i</var>] should follow
      <var>T</var>[<var>j</var>] and the second condition requires it to be the other way round. The
      situation is even worse, because if <var>P</var>[<var>i</var>] &cap; <var>P</var>[<var>j</var>] &ne; &#8709;, apparently, the order
      in which the shared record has been processed has been decided in the past, and
      this order is no longer expressed in the population of the various sets, but
      in general it is still relevant.
<p>      In our second model, the virtual order for the pair <var>T</var>[<var>i</var>], <var>T</var>[<var>j</var>] is
irrevocably decided as far as their interference with the data base is concerned,
as soon as for the first time holds
<p><var>A</var>[<var>i</var>] &cap; <var>P</var>[<var>j</var>] &ne; &#8709; <b>or</b>   <var>A</var>[<var>j</var>] &cap; <var>P</var>[<var>i</var>] &ne; &#8709;  .
<p class="noindent">Therefore we associate with each pair an antisymmetric function <var>V</var>(<var>i</var>,<var>j</var>) =
         <var>&#8722;V</var>(<var>j</var>,<var>i</var>); when the pair is created &mdash;i.e. when the second transaction starts to
        be under execution&mdash; <var>V</var>(<var>i</var>,<var>j</var>) is initialized with the value 0. During its life
        time it may remain constant, it may change its value once to either +1 or <var>&#8722;</var>1,
where 
<p><span class="noindent"><var>V</var>(<var>i</var>,<var>j</var>) </span>=<span class="noindent"> +1 </span>
<p class="noindent">means that in the virtual order <var>T</var>[<var>i</var>] has to precede <var>T</var>[<var>j</var>].
<p>      We now have the following invariant relations
<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tr>
    <td><p><var>i</var> &ne; <var>j</var> &rArr;   <var>A</var>[<var>i</var>] &cap; <var>A</var>[<var>j</var>] = &#8709;</p></td>

    <td align="right" valign="bottom">6)</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p class="noindent"> and deadlock is prevented, provided that we can renumber the transactions
  currently under execution in such a way that
<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tr>
    <td><p><span class="noindent"><var>i</var> < <var>j</var> &rArr;  {<var>F</var>[<var>i</var>] &cap; (<var>A</var>[<var>j</var>] &cup; <var>P</var>[<var>j</var>]) = &#8709; <b>and</b> <var>V</var>(<var>i</var>,<var>j</var>) &ge; 0}</span></p></td>
    <td align="right" valign="bottom"><span class="noindent">7)</span></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p class="noindent">for then <var>T</var>[0] can be carried to completion without violation to the decided
    virtual order.
<p>      The second model shows great similarity to the first one. Again, the only
point where it might be necessary to put a transaction to sleep is where it
would like to transfer a record from set <var>F</var> to set <var>A</var>. The points of progress
in one transaction that could result in the situation that sleeping transactions
could be woken up are (as before) explicit <var>F</var>-decrease and termination, but in
addition to those two the transition from <var>A</var> to <var>P</var>.
The problem of individual starvation can be dealt with in the same crude  
fashion as in the first model and for the time being we shall leave it at that.
<p class="noindent"><b>The third model.</b>
<p>      The second model is appropriate when each transaction modifies all its
active records. But that seems a rather exceptional situation and in our third
model we would like to exploit that simultaneous inspection of a current
record value by a number of parallel transactions is an absolutely innocent
operation. For that reason we split all sets into two: <var>F</var> into <var>FR</var> and <var>FW</var>, <var>A</var> into
<var>AR</var> and <var>AW</var> and <var>P</var> into <var>PR</var> and <var>PW</var>. Here <var>AR</var> are the &ldquo;read only records&rdquo;, while
records in set <var>AW</var> may also be modified. Initially the transaction starts with
<var>FW</var> equal to the universe and the other five sets empty. Permissible transfers
of a record are: from <var>FW</var> to <var>FR</var> and <var>AW</var>, from <var>FR</var> to <var>AR</var>, from <var>AW</var> to <var>PW</var> and from <var>AR</var> to <var>PR</var>.
<p>      Now formulae 3) through 7) can be modified systematically by changing
<p><var>X</var>[<var>i</var>] &cap; <var>Y</var>[<var>J</var>]
<p class="noindent">into
<p> (<var>XW</var>[<var>i</var>] &cap; <var>YW</var>[<var>j</var>]) &cup; (<var>XW</var>[<var>i</var>] &cap; <var>YR</var>[<var>j</var>]) &cup; (<var>XR</var>[<var>i</var>] &cap; <var>YW</var>[<var>j</var>]) 
<p class="noindent">i.e. from the four cross-products only the three in which writing is possibly
  involved, but not the fourth, the <var>RR</var> combination.
<p>      After this sytematic change we have formulae 3&#8242;) through 7&#8242;), describing
a model in which records shared for inspection only do not impose any mutual
exclusion or virtual ordering. The only difference between the third and the
second model is that in one transaction the transfer of a record from <var>FW</var> to
<var>FR</var> could have the side-effect of waking up a sleeping transaction.
<p class="noindent"><b>Note</b>. If a transaction upon inspection of a record in set <var>AW</var> (because it might
  have to modify it) discovers that it can leave the record unchanged, we can, if
  we so desire, admit the transfer of this record from set <var>AW</var> to set <var>AR</var>. In that
  case also this transition could have the side-effect that another sleeping
  transaction can now be woken up.
<p class="noindent"><b>Avoiding the danger of individual starvation.</b>
<p>      In view of the formal relationship between the second and the third
model it suffices to discuss the starvation problem in terms of the simpler 
formalism of the second model.
<p>      By the time, however, that we are going to tackle the starvation problem
seriously, we should bear in mind that up till now we have assumed that the
only reason for preventing progress of a transaction would be that otherwise
relations 3 or 7 would be violated. In a general system one must assume that
there will be other reasons as well: By the time that we bring into the picture
that most of the records will be in secondary store most of the time, reduction
of the traffic density between primary and secondary store might become a
worthy goal and we can envisage a system trying to collect transactions involving the same records. The system can try to do so by postponing transactions,
but also that strategic postponement must be void of the starvation danger.
<p>      With each transaction <var>T</var>[<var>i</var>] currently under execution we can associate
an so-called &ldquo;allowance counter&rdquo; <var>ac</var>[<var>i</var>] and its value will be equal to the
maximum number of other transactions allowed to run to completion before <var>T</var>[<var>i</var>]
will run to completion. This implies that upon termination of a transaction
all <var>ac</var>&rsquo;s associated with the remaining transactions will be decreased by 1.
We now superimpose upon our original safety condition that the transaction
can be renumbered in such a fashion that besides relation 7 also
<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tr>
    <td><p><var>i</var> &le; <var>ac</var>[<var>i</var>]</p></td>
    <td align="right" valign="bottom">8)</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p class="noindent">holds.
<p>      In that case <var>T</var>[0] can run to completion; its termination will decrease
the remaining <var>ac</var>&rsquo;s by 1; simultaneously the remaining transactions will shift
down over one place (i.e. the old <var>T</var>[1] becomes the new <var>T</var>[0]) and as a result
relation 8 will continue to hold.
<p>      Inside a transaction we have now three types of points where the system
may decide to put a transaction to sleep:
<p>request for record transfer from <var>F</var> to <var>A</var>
<p>request for potential strategic postponement
<p> request to terminate.
<p class="noindent">Whenever a transaction makes such a request that can be honoured without
  violating conditions 3, 7 and 8, the system is in general free to refuse the
  request and to put the transaction to sleep. That would admit the possibility
  of a completely sleeping system and no real time guarantee could be given, even
  if a maximum execution time for a transaction is known. We therefore impose
  the requirement that
  when the set of current transactions is non-empty, at least one
  transaction must be non-sleeping.
<p>      When a transaction is initiated and its <var>ac</var> is introduced its initial
value must be sufticiently high to guarantee 8; the number of transactions
currently under execution will certainly be sufficient. The higher the initial
value of the <var>ac</var>&rsquo;s, the greater the system&rsquo;s freedom in shuffling with the
transaction order, but the weaker any real time guarantee about possible delays.
<p>      Finally in the above parallel system the order in which the transactions
are terminated is a possible order for the transaction stream processed by the
purely sequential system that should show the same net reaction.
