<p class="noindent"><b>On representational abstraction</b>.
  <p>The usual higher level programming languages provide us with the
type &ldquo;<b>integer</b>&rdquo; allowing us to prescribe &ldquo;a:= b + c&rdquo; or to assert
&ldquo;a = b + c&rdquo;, regardless of the internally chosen interpretation. This
is <b>great</b>, for the alternative would have been to regard these variables
as bit strings, say; this would have been nasty in two respects: instead
of asserting &ldquo;a = b + c&rdquo; we would find ourselves forced to write down
the equations of the binary adder &mdash;which on that level would only add
to the confusion&mdash;, secondly we would be overspecific, because we would
(presumably) not object if our program operating on integers would be
executed on a decimal machine! So much for the power of representational
abstraction. Its power is so great that we would like to exploit it at
higher levels as well. We should, however, be aware of one vital fact,
viz. that while the highest level program does not fix a representation
for variables of type &ldquo;<b>integer</b>&rdquo;, it is fixed somewhere an how, viz. in
the implementation: someone has to bother!
<p>The most innocent way of regarding &ldquo;a type&rdquo; is as &ldquo;an attribute of
variables of that type&rdquo;, i.e. as the collection of different possible
values a variable of that type can have. (How this collection of different
values is defined is another matter: either by enumeration or by some
BNF-like recursive technique I guess.)
<p>We should be aware of the fact that this abstract definition of the
set of possible values is only one side of the coin: to compare it with
the procedure concept &mdash;embodying operational abstraction&mdash; it is as if
we have given an axiomatic definition of the semantics of the call without
&mdash;as yet&mdash; specifying an adequate body.
<p>To do justice to this observation we could talk for the purpose of
this discussion about &ldquo; an implemented type&rdquo;i.e. a defined class of values
together with a proposal as how to represent these different values. In
addition it should contain a proposal for the algorithmic operations
on the consituents of the representation in order to &ldquo;model&rdquo; the
operations on the abstract values.
<p>In the simplest case this proposal associates with each abstract
value one or more points in a little state space which is probably regarded
as the Cartesian product of smaller &mdash;&ldquo;known&rdquo;&mdash; state spaces. (One in the
case of &ldquo;a unique representation&rdquo;, more in the case of a &ldquo;non-unique 
representation&rdquo;. Note that not all points in our little Cartesian state space
need to correspond to a possible value of the abstract type!) In any case
our proposal for representation needs to give the correspondence between
abstract values and points in the little state space.
<p>On the above level of vagueness, everything is still OK: we have not
said much yet that could contradict itself. Let us, therefore, look for
problems.
There seems to be a marked difference between operational abstraction
and representational abstraction in the following sense. Given a program
with procedures the replacement of one procedure body by a semantically
equivalent one is a straightforward operation: the choice of the body
is only reflected in the &ldquo;static&rdquo; program text and in the (volatile!)
happening when the program is executed: with modest precautions it is
even possible to replace during execution of a program one body by a
semantically equivalent one that will be exercised during the second half
of the computation.
<p>The choice of representation, however, spreads all through the state
space of the computation: to start the execution of a program in binary
arithmetic and to switch half-way to decimal arithmetic is certainly <b>not</b>
such a trivial operation. One can even start asking oneself, whether one
could have both representations simultaneously: could we have simultaneously
&ldquo;binary integers&rdquo; and &ldquo;decimal integers&rdquo;? The fact that there are machines
with both binary and decimal arithmetic &mdash;at least: machines that are
presented as such&mdash; seems to make this question meaningful. It is, however,
utterly misleading.
<p>There are no such things as &ldquo;binary integers&rdquo;, nor &ldquo;decimal integers&rdquo;.
Both names are misnomers! The integers, according to Kronecker created by
the Good Lord and subsequently defined by the axioms of Peano are a concept
in which &ldquo;a number system&rdquo; has no place, let alone a specific number system.
We can have as types (possibly bounded) <b>integers</b>, and/or <b>bitstrings</b> and/or
<b>decimalstrings</b>. But neither a string of bits, not a string of decimals can
<b>be</b> an integer. We can associate &mdash;but this is at least a conceptual transfer
function!&mdash; with either string an integer value, but in both cases that
requires a quite distinct additional convention.
<p>(In this connection it is illuminating that the definition of a
programming language like ALGOL 60 does not mention a thing about internal
representation of integer variables, this in sharp contrast to most machine
manuals that usually start with ... a detailed description of the number
representation, the last thing that should be of any importance for the
programmer! Instead of operating on integers, one has there to operate on
the constituents of a specific representation and that is, of course, one
of the reasons why machine code programming is so tricky: you really have
to know the tules for representing negative numbers on a binary machine
before you can translate the test &ldquo;even(x)&rdquo; into an inspection of X&rsquo;s
least significant digit. As an aside: from previous confrontations with
COBOL I have retained the impression of an endless conceptual confusion
between integers and strings of decimal digits ....)
<p>Similarly there is no &ldquo;binary arithmetic&rdquo; nor &ldquo;decimal arithmetic&rdquo;:
Peano did not mention radix systems in his axioms!
<p>Let us now assume for a moment that we have a binary machine with a
number of &ldquo;decimal operations&rdquo; as an added facility; how are we going to
use it? (<b>Note</b> 1. It will become apparent that such an added facility is
to a large extent an added nuisance &mdash; as usual?&mdash; but we shall investigate
its use nevertheless. <b>Note</b> 2. The dual number representation is a rather
microscopic example of non-unique representation: for more sophisticated
types than integers it becomes more interesting.) In a purely binary machine
our higher level code does know nothing about the number representation; in
our mixed machine we should stick to that same level of transparency. I.e.
if an integer value can be represented by a string of bits or a string of
decimals (or possibly both) we should have what on that level is called
&ldquo;a tag&rdquo;, indicating which is the case. (A proposal could be something on
the following lines:
<br>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if both operands are available in one kind only and the kinds are equal,
produce the result of the same kind
<br>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if both operands are available in one kind only and the kinds differ
perform concurrently bot transfer functions and then act as
<br>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if both operands are available in both kinds, produce concurrently
the result of both kinds
<br>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if one operand is available in both types, the other one in one
kind only. produce a result of the latter kind, etc.
<p>The above is not a serious proposal, it is intended as an example
how the implementation could try to choose at any moment the most convenient
alternative.)
<p>It could very well be that the programmer knows that for some variables
a specific representation is more adequate than another. (This is 
particularly true when you have variables of the type &ldquo;set&rdquo;.) But it is my feeling
that such knowledge should be transmitted to the implementation in the form
of &ldquo;a hint&rdquo;: a parameter of the declaration that introduces the variable.
It is then up to the implementer to decide how much attention will be paid
to the hint. (In our example: even with hints of the form &ldquo;<b>integer</b> (dec)&rdquo;
and &ldquo;<b>integer</b>(bin)&rdquo; a program executed on the machine with the decimal
facilities should be transferrable to a machine without the decimal 
facilities without any change &mdash;the purely binary machine implementation can
be expected to ignore hints to do something in a locally impossible way!
<p>One can argue with respect to such a text with hints: &ldquo;Is the 
programmer now aware of the representation or is he not?&rdquo; Well, both of course!
He creates the major part of his text <b>as if</b> he could ignore the 
representation, but he knows full well that if such an abstraction is insufficiently
truthful, this full separation of concerns is denied to him and he has
to develop a controlled schizophrenia. That is what all programmers sometimes
are forced to do: we only try to assist him in controlling his schizophrenia.
What we try to achieve is that, although the program is perhaps only
realistic when the &ldquo;hints&rdquo; are taken into account, yet the program without
the &ldquo;hints&rdquo; can be regarded as &ldquo;logically complete&rdquo;.
<p align="center" class="noindent">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>    *</p> 
<p>For the sequel I take the position that we aim at a strict textual
separation between the places where the abstract variable is considered as
an unanalyzed whole and where it is considered as a composite object. Note
that this is meant to be a drastic decision, for instance damning ALGOL 60
&mdash;and many other programming languages&mdash; where on the same level one can
equally well refer to an array as a whole as to its individual elements,
allowing procedure calls such as &ldquo;P(A, A[i])&rdquo;, which I would prefer to
consider as confusing horrors.
<p>If we take such an attitude, we should pay attention to the following
question &mdash;even if we do not have complete and completely satisfactory
answers to them:
<br>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are exactly the benefits that we hope to derive from such a
separation?
<br>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What type of interface do we suggest between the two levels?
<p>A clear benefit is presented by the circumstance that &mdash;provided
that the abstract variable has decent properties&mdash; the upper level program
can be much clearer to understand and &mdash;even formally&mdash; easier to prove
to be correct. A program operating on complex numbers becomes mystified
when you express it in real and imaginary parts! (Most formal proof systems
that have been mechanized &mdash;King&rsquo;s &ldquo;Verifying Compiler&rdquo; and the like&mdash; seem
to suffer from the fact that they carry out the proofs in terms of the
primitive data types handled: the proofs become very quickly unwieldy.)
<p>A second benefit arises as soon as not all points of the local little
state space &mdash;built up as the Cartesian product of the state spaces of the
components&mdash; actually correspond to a value of the abstract variable. In
that case there is redundancy, a relation in that little state space must
be kept invariant. The textual separation pins the obligation to maintain
such an invariance quite explicitly down on that part of the text that
manipulates on the individual components. As many program improvements boil
down to a trading of storage space for computation time by storing redundant
information &mdash;that might be absorbed in the representation of an abstract
type?&mdash;, this second benefit also seems to be important. (It is here where
the &ldquo;unsafeness&rdquo; of for instance the PASCAL record really begins to hurt!)
<p>As the third benefit I see the possibility to change the representation
of an abstract type: in a sense the language &ldquo;scope rules&rdquo; will tell you
which parts of the program remain unaffected.
There is a fourth potential benefit of which I am not quite sure: it
might be to far-fetched, but you never know in these days of privacy and
security. It is conceivable that we would like to be able to give partial
access to information only; and mind you, this will not necessarily be
that certain bits are inaccessible and therefore unable to influence the
course of the computation: while the &ldquo;age of a person&rdquo; might be hidden,
you may yet get permission to compare the ages of two persons: the
relational operator &ldquo;older than&rdquo; might be at your disposal! I think that
more convincing examples can be constructed....
<p>Let us now turn to the question b), what type of interface we do
suggest between the two levels.
<p>We cannot only define an abstract variable, its layout in store, so
to speak, we must define operations and functions as well. In the case
that the abstract variable is represented by an enumerated set of variables
&mdash;such as you can declare at block entry&mdash; it has been suggested by C.A.R.
Hoare &mdash;I cannot give the exact reference, I think it was ACTA INFORMATICA&mdash;
to write a block with
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
a)</td><td>the declarations of the components needed to represent an instance
of the abstract variable, together with their initialization
</td>  </tr>  </table>
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
b)</td><td>functions defined on a variable of such a type: the algorithm would
then refer to the components of the abstract variable
</td>  </tr>  </table>
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
c) </td><td>updaters, i.e. operations modifying the value of the abstract
variable.
</td>  </tr>  </table>
<p>In the case of, for instance, the complex number, there would be
certainly the two functions &ldquo;re&rdquo; and &ldquo;im&rdquo;. They can be regarded as
&ldquo;characteristic functions&rdquo; in the sense that if you know these two values
you know all there is to know about that complex value. If &ldquo;z1&rdquo; and &ldquo;z2&rdquo;
are then two complex variables, the condition that they have equal
values can be written &ldquo;z1.re = z2.re and z1.im = z2.im&rdquo;. And for some
time I have felt that among the definition of the abstract type there must
be enough so as to be able to write a program (on the upper level!) that
can determine whether two values of the abstract variable are equal. (As
I have just done for the complex numbers.) I am no longer so sure of the
reasonableness of the requirement in view of the fourth (potential) benefit.
(In the example there is a way of establishing equality of the unaccessible
ages, because &ldquo;A older than B <b>or</b> B older than A&rdquo; is equivalent with
&ldquo;A.age &ne; B.age&rdquo;.)
<p>I am beginning to feel now, that &ldquo;equality of values&rdquo; is such a
fundamental property that we should allow the algorithm establishing the
equality of two values to be expressed on the lower level in terms of
the values of the composing parts. The syntax suggested by Hoare would
make this equality test an asymmetric algorithm, because he presented
these lower level algorithms as within an inner block with <b>one</b> instance
in the surrounding block. Also the operation &ldquo;swap(a, b)&rdquo;, where a and b
are variables of the same abstract type that should exchange their values
is only very clumsily coded in his suggestion. In other words, Hoare&rsquo;s
suggestion that the lower level algorithms are always executed subordinate
to one instance of the abstract variable and will have explicit access to
the components of that variable only, seems too restrictive. Up till now
I do not have a better proposal.
<p align="center" class="noindent">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>    *</p> 
<p>Finally I draw attention to the fact that the introduction of fancy
types may be expected to increase the number of partial functions and
operations. With the current sequencing primitives the upper level 
programme: has to sequence his program explicitly in such a way that none of
these functions or operations is invoked outside its domain. For robustness
sake, however, the lower level implementation will start checking ... that
the operation is not invoked outside its domain. First you give a complicated
duty to the upper level programmer, next you check dynamically that the
upper level programmer has not violated any of the rules! I mention, just
for the record, that my tentative notion of the &ldquo;guarded command&rdquo; is intended
to present a better interface.
