				<p class="noindent"><u>To hell with &ldquo;meaningful identifiers&rdquo;!</u></p>
				<p>This is about the construction of a bag of natural numbers with given sum and maximal product. In the following, a <em>maximal</em> bag means a bag that realizes for the sum of its content the maximum value of the product; for any given sum at least one maximal bag exists because the number of bags with given sum is finite.</p>
				<p>The first argument begins by characterizing bags that are not maximal. All characterizations follow the same pattern: non-maximality is demonstrated by showing how to construct a bag with the same sum and a <em>larger</em> product.</p>
				<p class="noindent"><u>Lemma 0</u> A bag containing 0 is not maximal</p>
				<p class="noindent"><u>Proof</u> Removing all zeros from the bag increases the product. (End of Proof.)</p>
				<p class="noindent"><u>Lemma 1</u> A bag containing 1 and at least one further element is not maximal.</p>
				<p class="noindent"><u>Proof</u> Replacing the 1 and another element by their sum increases the product. (End of Proof.)</p>
				<p class="noindent"><u>Corollary</u> For a sum &ge; 2, a bag containing a 1 is not maximal.</p>
				<p class="noindent"><u>Lemma 2</u> For x &gt; 4, a bag containing x is not maximal.</p>
				<p class="noindent"><u>Proof</u> We analyze the condition that splitting up <var>x</var> into 2 and <var>x</var> &ndash; 2 increases the product</p>

					<p>For sums 0 and 1 the problem has been settled &#x2014;{} and {1} respectively&#x2014;; for larger sums the search is restricted by the above to bags built from 2's, 3's, and 4's. One way to proceed is to remark that, since 2 + 2 = 4 and 2 * 2 = 4, bags containing a 4 are disposable. Narrowed down to bags built from 2's and 3's, the observations 2 + 2 + 2 = 3 + 3 and 2 * 2 * 2 &lt; 3 * 3 settle the problem.</p>
					<p>The ruling out of bags with elements &gt; 4, followed by the disposing of bags with a 4, makes it very tempting to combine those argument and state</p>

					<p>Neat as this may seem, the argument is now &#x2014;as Paul Pritchard made me see&#x2014; fallacious, as we can see from the following simplified example.</p>
					<p>Let us consider bags whose elements add up to 2&#x2219;<var>N</var>.</p>
					<p class="noindent">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bags containing even elements are disposable.</p>
					<p class="noindent"><u>Proof</u> &nbsp;&nbsp;Each even element can be written as the sum of two odd values. (End of Proof.)</p>
					<p class="noindent">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bags containing odd elements are disposable.</p>
					<p class="noindent"><u>Proof</u> Since 2&#x2219;<var>N</var> is even, the number of odd elements is even; hence the odd elements can be eliminated by replacing pairs of them by their sum. (End of Proof.)</p>
					<p class="noindent">And now the conclusion is, of course, that we can restrict the search space to bags of natural numbers that are neither even nor odd, i.e. to the empty bag!</p>
					<p>Back to our problem of maximizing the product. It seems instructive to analyze what went wrong when we introduced our disposable bags. To simplify the discussion I restrict myself to bags of &ldquo;plurals&rdquo; with a &ldquo;plural&rdquo; sum. (&ldquo;plural&rdquo; means &ldquo;integer and &ge; 2&rdquo;; like &ldquo;integer&rdquo; and &ldquo;natural&rdquo; it is both a noun and an adjective.)</p>
					<p>The trouble has been invited by the fact that we did not give a precise definition of the notion &ldquo;disposable.&rdquo; Reformulating (0) for plurals and without the adjective &ldquo;disposable&rdquo; yields, for instance,</p>
					<p class="noindent">(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;For every bag of plurals there exists a bag of plurals &lt;4, with the same sum and at least the same product.</p>
					<p>There are two ways of looking at this theorem: it is a theorem about all bags of plurals to be proved by mathematical induction, or it is an existence theorem that we can demonstrate by developing a terminating algorithm that constructs a witness. Both views boil down to the same thing as both require a well-founded order on finite bags.</p>
					<p>[When we characterize each bag by its &#x2014;natural&#x2014; frequency function <var>f</var>: <var>f</var>.<var>x</var> is the number of occurrences of <var>x</var> in the bag, the well-founded order is the lexical order on the sequences <var>f</var>.<var>x</var> in the order of decreasing <var>x</var>. Splitting up <var>x</var> into <var>x</var> &ndash; 2 and 2 corresponds to</p>
					<p><var>f</var>.<var>x</var>, <var>f</var>.(<var>x</var> &ndash; 2), <var>f</var>.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <var>f</var>.<var>x</var> &ndash;1, <var>f</var>.(<var>x</var> &ndash; 2) + 1, <var>f</var>.2 + 1</p>
					<p class="noindent">which represents a lexical decrease of the sequence. Or simpler: sum &ndash; #elements in the bag.]</p>
					<p>Compared to (1), the weaker Lemma 2</p>
					<p class="noindent">(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;For every bag of plurals, there exists a bag of plurals &le; 4 with the same sum and at least the same product.</p>
					<p class="noindent">does not require mathematical induction for its proof. The existence of maximal bags not being in doubt, it suffices to demonstrate that a bag with a plural &gt; 4 is not maximal.</p>
					<p>With the replacement of Lemma 2 and a separate treatment of 4's in the bag by (1), we have eliminated a case analysis at the price of a proof by mathematical induction. I consider that price rather heavy.</p>
					<p>The clearest moral of the above is never to introduce terms (like &ldquo;disposable&rdquo;) on the basis of &ldquo;you know I mean, don't you?&rdquo; To hell with the &ldquo;meaningful identifiers!&rdquo; The havoc they create is not confined to programming but extends over all of mathematics.</p>
