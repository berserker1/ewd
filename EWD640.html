<b>Finding the correctness proof of a concurrent program</b>.
<p>(Those who have seen EWD622 will recognize the following as an improved
treatment of one of the versions of the concurrent program developed in that
report. The main improvement consists of the heuristics for finding the
correctness proof: the heuristics effectively buffer the shock of invention
which, in EWD622 - 11, was indicated by &ldquo;A bold guess is to interpret....&rdquo;.
<p>For the benefit of those who have not seen EWD622, this note is written
as a self-contained text that fully redescribes the problem. They have 
furthermore the advantage that they won&rsquo;t be confused by changed notations and meanings
of variables.)
<p>In the following y denotes a vector of N components y[i] for
0 &le; i &lt; N . with the identifier f we shall denote a vector-valued function
of a vector-valued argument, and the algorithm concerned solves the equation
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%>  </td><td valign=top>
y = f(y)</td><td align=right>(1)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
or, introducing f0, f1, f2,.... for the components of f
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%>  </td><td valign=top>
y[i] = fi(y) for 0 &le; i &lt; N .</td><td align=right>(2)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
<p>It is assumed that the initial value of y and the function f are
such that the repeated assignments of the form
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%>  </td><td valign=top>
&lt;y[i]:= fi(y) &gt;</td><td align=right>(3)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
will lead in a finite number of steps to y being a solution of (1). In (3)
we have used Lamport&rsquo;s notation of the angle brackets: they enclose &ldquo;atomic
actions&rdquo; which can be implemented by ensuring between them mutual exclusion
in time (when they are considered &ldquo;to take time&rdquo;).{In order to guarantee
termination we must assume that the sequence of i-values for which the
assignments (3) are carried out must be one of some sort of &ldquo;fair random,
order&rdquo; in which, for instance, a finite upper bound is known to exist for
the number of consecutive assignments &mdash;i.e. i-values&mdash; in which a given j
(0 &le; j &lt; N) does not occur: in other words, we assume the absence of 
individual starvation somehow guaranteed. (He who refuses to make that assumption
can read the following as a proof of partial correctness.)
                  
<p>For the purpose of this note it suffices to know that functions f
exist such that with a proper value of y equation (1) will be solved by a
finite number of assignments (3). How for a given f and initial value y
this property can be established is <b>not</b> the subject of this paper. (He who
refuses to assume that the function f has that delightful property is free
to do so: he can, again, read the following as a proof of partial correctness
that states that <b>when</b> our concurrent program has terminated, (1) is 
satisfied.)
<p>Besides the global vector y there is a global boolean array h ,
with elements h[i] for 0 &le; i &lt; N , all of which are true to start with.
we now consider the following program of N-fold concurrency, in which each
atomic action modifies at most one global array element. We give the program
first and shall explain the notation afterwards.
<p>The concurrent program we are considering consists of the following
N components (0 &le; i &lt; N):
<table> <tr> <td colspan = 5>
comp.i:                                                               </td> </tr> <tr> <td>L0: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td colspan = 4>
       <b>do</b> &lt; (<u>E</u> j: h[j]) &gt; &rarr;                  </td> </tr> <tr> <td>L1:</td> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td colspan = 3>
                &lt; <b>if</b> y[i] = fi(y) &rarr; h[i]:= false &gt;  </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td colspan = 2>
                  &#x25af; y[i] &ne; fi(y) &rarr; y[i]:= fi(y) &gt; ; </td> </tr> <tr> <td>L2j:</td> <td></td> <td></td> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
                                (<u>A</u> j: &lt; h[j]:= true &gt; )  </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td colspan = 3>
                <b>fi</b>                                             </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td colspan = 4>
       <b>od</b>                                                      </td> </tr>
</table>

In line L0 , (<u>E</u> j: h[j]) is an abbreviation for (<u>E</u> j: 0 &le; j &lt; N: h[j]) ;
for the sake of brevity we shall use this abbreviation throughout this note.
By writing &lt; (<u>E</u> j: h[j]) &gt; in the guard we have made the inspection whether
a true h[j] can be found into an atomic action.
The opening angle bracket &ldquo; &lt; &rdquo; in L1 has two corresponding closing
brackets, corresponding to the two &ldquo;atomic alternatives&rdquo;; it means that in
the same atomic action the guards are evaluated and either &ldquo;h[i]:= false&rdquo; or
&ldquo;y[i]:= fi(y)&rdquo; is executed. In the latter case, N separate atomic actions
follow, each setting an h[j] to true: in line L2j we have used the 
abbreviation (<u>A</u> j: &lt; h[j]:= true &gt; ) for the program that performs the N atomic
actions &lt; h[0]:= true &gt; through &lt; h[N-1]:= true &gt; in some order which we
                   
don&rsquo;t specify any further.
Our target state is that y is a solution of (1), or, more explicitly
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%>  </td><td valign=top>
(<u>A</u> j: y[j] = fj(y)) .</td><td align=right>(4)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
We first observe that (4) is an invariant of the repeatable statements: in
the alternative constructs, always the first alternative will be chosen, leaving
y , and hence (4) unaffected. We can even conclude a stronger invariant
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%>  </td><td valign=top>
<b>non</b> (<u>E</u> j: h[j]) <b>and</b> (<u>A</u> j: y[j] = fj(y))</td><td align=right>(5)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
or, equivalently
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%>  </td><td valign=top>
(<u>A</u> j: <b>non</b> h[j]) <b>and</b> (<u>A</u> j: y[j] = fj(y))</td><td align=right>(5&rsquo;)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
for, when (5) holds, no assignment h[i]:= false can destroy the truth of
(<u>A</u> j: <b>non</b> h[j]). When (4) holds, the assumption of fair random order implies
that within a finite number of steps (5) will hold. But then the guards of
the repetitive constructs are false, and all components will terminate nicely
with (4) holding. The critical point is: can we guarantee that none of the
components terminates too soon? In order to prove that termination implies
that (4) holds, we have to prove the universal truth of
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%>  </td><td valign=top>
(<u>E</u> j: h[j]) <b>or</b> (<u>A</u> j: y[j] = fj(y)) .</td><td align=right>(6)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
Relation (6) certainly holds when the N components are started because
initially we start with all h[j] true. We are only left with the obligation 
to prove the invariance of (6); the remaining part of this report is devoted
to that proof, and to how it can be discovered. 
<p>We get a hint of the kind of difficulties we may expect when trying to
prove the invariance of (6) as soon as we realize that the first term is a
compact notation for
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%>  </td><td valign=top>
h[0] <b>or</b> h[1] <b>or</b> h[2] <b>or</b> ... <b>or</b> h[N-1]</td><td align=right>
</td>  </tr>  </table>
which can become false when, as a result of &ldquo;h[i]:= false&rdquo; the <b>last</b> true
h[j] disappears. That is ugly!
<p>Proving a mathematical theorem is often only feasible by proving a
stronger &mdash;but, somehow, more manageable&mdash; theorem instead. In direct analogy:
instead of trying to prove the invariant truth of (6) we shall try to prove
the invariant truth of a stronger assertion that we get by replacing the  
                  
conditions y[j] = fj(y) by stronger ones. Because under the universal truth
of (Q <b>or</b> R) , the relation non R is stronger than Q , we can strengthen
(6) into
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%>  </td><td valign=top>
(<u>E</u> j= h[j]) <b>or</b> (<u>A</u> j: non Rj)</td><td align=right>(7)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
provided 
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%>  </td><td valign=top>
(<u>A</u> j: y[j] = fj(y) <b>or</b> Rj)</td><td align=right>(8)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
holds universally. (Someone who sees these heuristics presented in this
manner for the first time may experience this as juggling, but I am afraid that
it is quite standard and that we had better get used to it.)
<p>What have we gained by the introduction of the N predicates Rj?
Well: the freedom to choose them! More precisely: the freedom to define them
in such a way that we can prove the universal truth of (8) &mdash;which is 
structurally quite pleasant&mdash; while the universal truth of (7) &mdash;which is 
structurally equally &ldquo;ugly&rdquo; as (6)&mdash; follows more or less directly from the definition
of the Rj&rsquo;s : that is the way in which we may hope that (7) is more 
&ldquo;manageable&rdquo; than the original (6).
<p>In order to find a proper definition of the Rj&rsquo;s , we analyse our 
obligation to <b>prove</b> the invariance of (8).
<p>If we only looked at the invariance of (8), one might think, that a
definition of the Rj&rsquo;s in terms of y:
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%>  </td><td valign=top>
Rj = (y[j] &ne; fj(y))</td><td align=right>
</td>  </tr>  </table>
would be a sensible choice. A moment&rsquo;s reflection tells us that that definition
does not help: it would make (8) universally true by definition, and the 
right-hand terms of (6) and (7) would be identical, whereas (7) was intended to be
stronger than (6).
<p>For two reasons we are looking for a definition of the Rj&rsquo;s in which the
y does not occur: firstly, it is then that we can expect the proof of the
universal truth of (8) to amount to something &mdash;and, therefore, to contribute
to the argument&mdash; , secondly, we would like to conclude the universal truth
of (7) &mdash;which does not mention y at all&mdash; from the definition of the Rj&rsquo;s.
In other words, we propose a <b>definition</b> of the Rj&rsquo;s which does not refer
to y at all: only with such a definition the replacement of (6) by (7) and
                 
(8) localizes our dealing with y completely to the proof of the universal
truth of (8).
<p>Because we want to define the Rj&rsquo;s independently of y , because initially
we cannot assume that for some j-value y[j] = fj(y) holds, and because (8)
must hold initially, we must assume that initially
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%>  </td><td valign=top>
(<u>A</u> j: Rj)</td><td align=right>(9)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
holds. Because, initially, all the h[j] are true, the initial truth of (9)
is guaranteed if the Rj&rsquo;s are defined in such a way that we have
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%>  </td><td valign=top>
(<u>E</u> j: <b>non</b> h[j]) <b>or</b> (<u>A</u> j: Rj) .</td><td align=right>(10)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
We observe, that (10) is again of the recognized ugly form we are trying to
get rid of. We have some slack &mdash;that is what the Rj&rsquo;s are being introduced
for&mdash; and this is the moment to decide to try to come away with a stronger
&mdash;but what we have called: &rdquo;structurally more pleasant&ldquo; &mdash; relation such as
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%>  </td><td valign=top>
(A j: <b>non</b> h[j] <b>or</b> Rj)</td><td align=right>(11)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
from which (10) immediately follows. We can already divulge that, indeed,
(11) will be one of the defining equations for the Rj&rsquo;s .
<p>From (11) it follows that the algorithm will start with all the Rj&rsquo;s
true. From (8) it follows that the truth of Rj can be appreciated as &ldquo;the
equation y[j] = fj(y) need not be satisfied&rdquo;, and from (7) it follows that
in our final state we want to have all the Rj&rsquo;s equal to false.
<p>Let us now look at the alternative construct
<table> <tr> <td align=right>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;L1: </td> <td colspan = 3>
      &lt;<b>if</b> y[i] = fi(y) &rarr; h[i]:= false &gt;            </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td colspan = 2>
          &#x25af; y[i] &ne; fi(y) &rarr; y[i]:= f(y) &gt;;          </td> </tr> <tr> <td align=right>L2j:</td> <td></td> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
                                 (<u>A</u> j: &lt; h[j]:= true &gt;) </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td colspan = 2>
          <b>fi</b>                                                  </td> </tr>
</table>
We observe that the first alternative sets h[i] false, and that the second
one, as a whole, sets all h[j] true. As far as the universal truth of (11)
is concerned, we therefore conclude that in the first alternative Ri is 
allowed to, and hence <b>may</b> become false, but that in the second alternative as a
whole, all Rj&rsquo;s <b>must</b> become true.
                        
<p>Let us now confront the two atomic alternatives with (8). Because, when
the first alternative is selected, only y[i] = fi(y) has been observed, the
universal truth of (8) is not destroyed by it, provided:
<p>In the execution of the first atomic alternative
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%>  </td><td valign=top>
&lt; y[i] = fi(y) -. h[i]:= false &gt;</td><td align=right>
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>  </td><td valign=top>
<b>no</b> Rj for j &ne; i may change from true to false.</td><td align=right>(12)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
<p>Confronting the second atomic alternative
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%>  </td><td valign=top>
&lt;y[i] &ne; fi(y) &rarr; y[i]:= fi(y)&gt;</td><td align=right>
</td>  </tr>  </table>
<br>with (8), and observing that upon its completion <b>none</b> of the relations
y[j] = fj(y) needs to hold, we conclude that the second atomic alternative
itself must already cause a final state in which all the Rj&rsquo;s are true, in
spite of the fact that the subsequent assignments h[j]:= true &mdash;which
would each force an Rj to true on account of (11)&mdash; have not been executed
yet. In short: in our definition for the Rj&rsquo;s we must include besides (11)
another reason why an Rj should be defined to be true.
<p>As it stands, the second atomic alternative only modifies y , but we:
had decided that the definition of the Rj&rsquo;s would not be expressed in terms
of y ! The only way in which we can formulate the additional reason for
an Rj to be true is in terms of an <b>auxiliary</b> variable (to me introduced in
a moment), whose value is changed in conjunction with the assignment to y[i] .
It has to force each Rj to true until the subsequent assignment
&lt; h[j]:= true &gt; does so via (11). Because the second atomic alternative is
followed by N subsequent, separate atomic actions &lt; h[j]:= true &gt; &mdash;one
for each value of j &mdash; it stands to reason that we introduce for comp.i
an auxiliary local boolean array ri with elements ri[j] for 0 &le; j &lt; N .
Their initial (and &ldquo;neutral&rdquo;) value is true. The second atomic alternative of
L1 sets them all to false, the atomic statements L2j will reset them to true
one at a time.
<p>In the following annotated version of comp.i we have inserted local
assertions between braces. In order to understand the local assertions about
ri it suffices to remember that L1 is local to comp.i . The local assertion
Ri in the second atomic alternative of L1 is justified by the guard
                  
y[i] &ne; fi(y) in conjunction with (8). We have further incorporated in our,
annotation the consequence of (12) and the fact that the execution of a second
alternative will never cause an Rj to become false: a true Ri can only
become false by virtue of the execution of the first atomic alternative of
L1 by comp.i itself! Hence, Ri is true all through the execution of the
second alternative of comp.i .
<br>comp.i:

</table>
<p>On account of (11) Rj will be true upon completion of L2j. But the
second atomic alternative of L1 ,should already have made Rj true, and it
should remain so until L2j is executed. The precondition of L2j, as given
in the annotation, hence tells us the &rdquo;other reason besides
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%>  </td><td valign=top>
(<u>A</u> j: <b>non</b> h[j] <b>or</b> Rj)</td><td align=right>(11)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
why an Rj should be defined to be true&ldquo;:
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%>  </td><td valign=top>
(A i, j: <b>non</b> Ri <b>or</b> ri[j] <b>or</b> Rj) .</td><td align=right>(13)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
Because it is our aim to get eventually all the Rj&rsquo;s false, we <b>define</b>
the Rj&rsquo;s as the <b>minimal</b> solution of (11) and (13), minimal in the sense
of: as few Rj&rsquo;s true as possible.
<p>A second look shows how the minimal solution is found. It is a sort of
transitive closure: starting with the set of Rj&rsquo;s forced true by (11) &mdash;on
account of falsity of <b>non</b> h[j]&mdash; , if necessary we extend this set &mdash;possibly
in cascades&mdash; with the Rj&rsquo;s forced true by (13) &mdash;on account of falsity of 
<b>non</b> Ri <b>or</b> ri[j]&mdash; .
<p>For a value of i , for which
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%>  </td><td valign=top>
(<u>A</u> j: ri[j])</td><td align=right>(14)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
                     
holds, the truth of Ri forces no further true Rj&rsquo;s via (13); consequently,
when such an Ri becomes false, no other Rj-values are then affected. This,
and the fact that the first atomic alternative of L1 is executed under the
truth of (14) tells us, that with our definition of the Rj&rsquo;s requirement
(12) is, indeed, met. 
<p>We have proved the universal truth of (8) by defining the Rj&rsquo;s as the
minimal solution of (11) and (13). The universal truth of (7) , however, is
now obvious. If the leFt-hand term of (7) is false, we have
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%>  </td><td valign=top>
(<u>A</u> j:<b>non</b> h[j]),</td><td align=right>
</td>  </tr>  </table>
and (11) and (13) have_as minimal solution all Rj&rsquo;s false, i.e.
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%>  </td><td valign=top>
(<u>A</u> j: <b>non</b> Rj)</td><td align=right>,
</td>  </tr>  </table>
which is the second term of (7).
