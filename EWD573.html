<p class=noindent><b>A great improvement.</b>
<p>After my return from my last trip the first thing W.H.J.Feijen en M.Rem
showed me was a much improved definition of &ldquo;wdec&rdquo;, for which they gave the credit
to my colleague F.E.J.Kruseman Aretz. In [1] I had written:
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
</td><td>&ldquo;More specifically: we shall use the notation wp(S, R), where S denotes
a statement list and R some condition on the state of the system, to
denote the weakest pre-condition for the initial state of the system such
that activation of S is guaranteed to lead to a properly terminating
activity leaving the system in a final state satisfying the post-condition
R .&rdquo;
</td>  </tr>  </table>
For a well-chosen programming language the article continues by defining how
for any given S and R the pre-condition wp(S, R) is derived. One page
later, when dealing with a repetitive construct and its termination, [1] continues:
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
</td><td>&ldquo;Let t denote some integer function, defined on the state space, and
let wdec(S, t) denote the weakest pre-condition such that activation
of S is guaranteed to lead to a properly terminating activity leaving
the system in a final state such that the value of t is decreased by
at least 1 (compared to its initial value). [...] The relation between
wp and wdec is as follows. For any point X in state space we can
regard wp(S, t &le; t0) as an equation with t0 as the unknown. Let its
smallest solution for t0 be tmin(X). (Here we-have added the explicit
dependence on the state X .) Then tmin(X) can be interpreted as the
lowest upper bound for the final value of t if the mechanism S is
activated with x as initial state. Then, by definition, wdec(S, t) =
(tmin(X) &le; t(x) - 1) = (tmin(X) &lt; t(x)).&rdquo;
</td>  </tr>  </table>
<p>Kruseman Aretz&rsquo;s definition is
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
</td><td>wdec(S, t) = wp(S, t &lt; t0)<sub>t</sub><sup>t0</sup>
</td>  </tr>  </table>
where the notation R<sub>x</sub><sup>y</sup> is used to denote a copy of the expression R in which
each occurrence of the variable x is replaced by y (or by (y) if necessary).
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=20%>
Example. Let S be</td><td><b>if</b> true &rarr; x:= x - y
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>
</td><td>&nbsp; &#x25af; true - x:= x - z
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>
</td><td><b>fi</b>
</td>  </tr>  </table>
and let t = x .
<br>Then &mdash;see [1]&mdash; we have:
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td colspan = 2>
      wp(S, t &lt; t0) =                                                                         </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td colspan = 2>
      (true <b>or</b> true) <b>and</b> (true &rArr; wp(&ldquo;x:= x - y&rdquo;, x &lt; t0)       </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
                   <b>and</b> (true &rArr; wp(&ldquo;x:= x - z&rdquo;, x &lt; t0) =              </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td colspan = 2>
      wp(&ldquo;x:= x - y&rdquo;, x &lt; t0) <b>and</b> wp(&ldquo;x:= x - z&rdquo;, x &lt; t0) = </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td colspan = 2>
      (x - y &lt; t0) <b>and</b> (x - z &lt; t0) .                                               </td> </tr>
</table>
Hence wdec(S, t) = wp(S, t &lt; t0)<sub>t</sub><sup>t0</sup> = (x - y &lt; x) <b>and</b> (x - z &lt; x) = y &gt; 0 <b>and</b> z &gt; 0
<p>This is much simpler than my original treatment. Analogous to the first
five lines, we would have to derive first
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
      wp(S, t &le; t0) = (x - y &le; t0) <b>and</b> (x - z &le; t0) . </td> </tr>
</table>
Then we would have to find the smallest solution for t0 satisfying that equation
&mdash;and that is not a very standard operation!&mdash;; in this case we would find
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
      tmin = max(x - y, x - z) </td> </tr>
</table>
and then we would derive
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
      wdec(S, t) = tmin &lt; t = max(x - y, x - z) &lt; x = max(- y, - 2) &lt; 0 = min(y, z) &gt; 0 .</td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>
                                                              </td> </tr>
</table>
(End of example.)
<p>The example shows that Kruseman Aretz&rsquo;s alternative definition does not
only embody a conceptual simplification, but that it also smooths the formal
labour to be performed. It couples in a very direct way the derived condition
wdec with the fundamental condition wp in a way that is very familiar from
the axiom of assignment.
<p align="center" class="noindent">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>*</p> 
<p>In retrospect I blame myself for acquiescing in my ugly original definition.
I knew quite well that it was ugly: it was preceded in [1] by &ldquo;Note (which can be
skipped at first reading).&rdquo; But I have failed to hear my own warning!
<p align="center" class="noindent">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>*</p> 
<p>It was only after the above had been typed that I was told about the
heuristics that had led to the new formulation of wdec . For that part, Kruseman
Aretz gave the credit to M.Rem: it seems to have been the typical multi-person
achievement, in which it is very hard to reconstruct later who has contributed what.
The argument is the following. Let us introduce an auxiliary variable,
t0 say, in which the value of t is recorded prior to the execution of S .
(For the sake of&rsquo; this recording we assume that the value of t can be &ldquo;computed&rdquo;,
so that it can be assigned to t0 .) Then we define
      wdec(S, t) = wp(&ldquo;t0:= t; S&rdquo;, t &lt; t0)
because the weakest pre-condition that &ldquo;t0:= t; S&rdquo; is guaranteed to establish
t &lt; t0 is, indeed, the weakest pre-condition for S such that S is guaranteed
to decrease t (by at least one, because t is an integer-valued function).
But, thanks to the axiom of concatenation, this right-hand side reduces to
         = wp(t0:= t, wp(S, t &lt; t0)
which, thanks to the axiom of assignment, reduces to
         = wp(S, t &lt; t0):<sub>t</sub><sup>t0</sup>
and that is exactly the expression I gave on EWD573 - 0 .
