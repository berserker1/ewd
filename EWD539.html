<p class=noindent>1st December 1975 
<p class=noindent><u>Mathematics Inc., a private letter from its Chairman.
</u>
<p>Dear ... ,
<p>Yes, indeed, it has been a hectic year! Thank you for your kind feelings.
As a matter of fact it started already around Xmas last year, when the rumour
reached us that the International Research Development Corporation IRDC was
trying to penetrate our market! IRDC is represented by Obfuscate et al., that
old clannish sollicitors firm in Oldcaste-upon-Time, which &mdash;as luck would
have it!&mdash; employs a former classmate of mine. I wrote him a letter &mdash;full
of sugar, you may be sure!&mdash; as if I were appealing to him for legal advice.
It all worked our beautifully, he even did send us a draft contract, thus
providing us with all the information we wanted to have! It was all most
reassuring: IRDC is so firmly entangled in legal complications that they are
no longer a serious threat. Our monopoly is safe &mdash; and in case of problems:
we have arranged a secret affair between the nightporter of the Hosanna
Building and the second daughter from old Obfuscate&rsquo;s first marriage, so
blackmail is always there as emergency exit.
<p>The whole affair had one nasty consequence: in our moment of panic we
felt that we had to <b>do</b> something, and our Proof of the Riemann Hypothesis has
been brought out into the field, contrary to the advice of our marketing
manager who felt that it still required too much maintenance. And right he
was: we can &mdash;and do!&mdash; burn our stove with the incoming trouble reports!
End of March we have transferred fifty mathematicians from Production to
Field Support, thus solving two problems at once.
<p>Business being what it was, something had to be done about production,
for our stock of unsold theorems was growing beyond the acceptible limits.
I have always argued that we should have a reasonable amount of spare theorems
in stock, but in March they already occupied nearly two full floors of the
Hosanna Building! Besides the transfer of the fifty mathematicians &mdash;we have,
of course selected the fifty most productive ones&mdash; we have returned to our
old method of productivity measuring: since February 1974 we measured 
mathematician productivity by the number of new results obtained per month; we are
now back on the more realistic and, after all, also more objective technique
of counting the number of lines of proof produced per week. Thanks to those
two measures, the stack of unsold theorems, I am happy to say, is slowly
shrinking back to normal size.
<p>But for a few little, specialized firms (one in finite geometry and
another one in combinatorial logic), Mathematics Inc. has now full control
of the mathematical market, a circumstance that is certain to create both
political and economic problems. It is not yet an open battle, but the first
symptoms of revolt against our dominance become visible for the discerning
eye.
<p>For the time being we have nothing to fear, for our greatest allies
are and remain the universities, their departments of mathematics, I mean.
They should fight us to death, because the more we proceed, the more 
obsolete they become, and in the end they will be abolished as superfluous. But
the technique is so simple! One just sponsors a conference that one calls a
&ldquo;symposium&rdquo; with only invited university professors as participants. One
chooses a nice subject like &ldquo;The Impact of Mathematics on Society in the
Eighties&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Role of Mathematical Education in Preparing for the Future&rdquo;
or any other nil-topic. They are so flattered, they come in as an eager flock,
proudly carrying their badges home when it is all over. It is pathetic! But
also absolutely effective! Did you know that our Differentiation Kit is now
used at 378 universities, all over the world? All their alumni will have
to subscribe to our &ldquo;Journal of Kit Differentiation&rdquo; for the rest of their
lives, if they want to remain up to date. The whole movement has now such
an impetus that it proceeds without us pushing it anymore; the French have
already founded a separate Society for Theoretical Kit Differentiation. It
is the same story with our Linear Algebra Kit, our Integration Kit, and our
Statistics Kit. It fully absorbs and paralyzes them, leaving the field open
for us. Our only obligation is to modify the Kits regularly, that is, to
change their appearance slightly, just enough to suggest progress. And really,
the universities love them: they always fall for the newest model! They feel
themselves superios to the other backward universities and colleges that have
not yet converted to Kit Mathematics.
<p>You know that the overall economic, political, and social aspects of
this whole venture interest me more than the purely technical issues. But
the latter are intriguing too! As soon as Mathematics Inc. grew beyond one
hundred employees &mdash;can you remember how long ago that was? it seems ages...&mdash;
it was clear that, no matter what we would tackle, the diversity of our 
products and manufacturing techniques would create havoc from the organizational
point of view. As standardization of products is only possible to a very
limited extent &mdash;the market place somehow insists on variety&mdash; we had to
standardize our manufacturing techniques. And we are proud of our IR System
for Integrated Reasoning, and I think justly so. In the beginning the IR
System was not too successful, because we needed a computer and chose the
then fashionable 1033-alpha, a machine for which the MTBF transpired to be
of the order of magnitude of twenty minutes. The IR Systems works much better
since we have replaced it by the new model 1035-omega, for which via a switch
on the console the parity check can be disabled. As soon as we had the new
machine, IR made significant progress: the whole IR System now consists of
the following languages:
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
ASL</td><td>Axiom Statement Language
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>
LSL</td><td>Lemma Statement Language
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>
TSL</td><td>Theorem Statement Language
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>
PSL</td><td>Proof Statement Language
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>
PVL</td><td>Proof Verification Language
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>
PRL</td><td>Proof Refuting Language (our main debuggin aid)
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>
IL</td><td>Inference Language.
</td>  </tr>  </table>
Their mutual relation is roughly as follows
<table> <tr>
<td  rowspan=2><IMG SRC="EWD539IM1.png" NAME="relation" BORDER=0></td>  
<td>Legenda:</td>   
<td>arrows denote causal<br>connection.</td>    
</tr> <tr>     
<td><IMG SRC="EWD539IM2.png" NAME="relation" BORDER=0></td>      
<td>means that the vertical <br>one controls the <br>horizontal one.</td>      
</tr></table> 
Actually this is a slight simplification, because it refers only to the
high-level languages PVL, FSL, and PRL, while we have the corresponding
low-level languages pvl, ps1, and prl as well: they are only needed when
the IR-facilities need more efficient exploitation.
As you see immediately from the above diagram, ASL, LSL and TSL are
purely syntactic languages without any semantic contents, PSL is a language
with an ambiguous, nondeterministic syntax and only first-order semantics,
while only PVL and PRL have second-order semantics. IL &mdash;although we call
it Inference Language for the sake of homogeneity&mdash; is, of course, no language
at all: it is no more than the specification of the interpretation that can
supply quasi-semantics for ASL, LSL, and TSL.
It is amazing that people have never thought about the coupling of
reasoning controlling activities, but once you have got the idea, it is
clear that the above scheme provides all the facilities you may ever need.
Our IR System &mdash;which, of course, is for internal use only&mdash; has been very
successful. (I have heard rumours that the application of PRL to Riemann
Proof will require a 1033-omega-super, extended with a quadruple-length
complex arithmetic unit. Some guys are so fanatic that they want to order
one, but &mdash;thank goodness!&mdash; I hold the purse strings, and I think that I
can convince them that also in this case we had better stick to the company
policy &mdash;which, after all, has always been very successful&mdash; of leaving the
last stage of quality control to those rare customers that think that they
&rsquo;really need that extra quality.)
<p>Needless to say, I consider the main benefits of the IR System to be
psychological and sociological: the presence of the tool has effectuated more
homogeneity in the company than regulations could ever have achieved. There
was a time that our topologists could not communicate with the number theorists,
they lived in different worlds, although they could work on the same floor!
But the IR System provides a standard, common universe of discourse, and,
again they understand each other. You can believe me or not, but the other
day I saw one guy of the Riemann Group and another guy from the Four Colour
Project exchange a few IL-cards! I cannot describe to you how happy that
observation made me: at that moment I knew that I had founded a living
company. Semper floreat et crescat!

PS. Secret! We are, of course, constantly trying to protect our company against
the possible consequences of changing attitudes, and we are not blind to the
current anti-intellectualistic undercurrents in our society that rouse popular
feeling against Reason. We keenly observe the semi-mystic &ldquo;back-to-nature&rdquo;
movements that want to do away with organization, with power, with shaving,
bra&rsquo;s and socks. They provide an alibi for the second rate college teacher
preaching that &ldquo;truth is dehumanized if it has to be proved&rdquo; and &ldquo;true truth
is what one feels to be true&rdquo; etc. In view of this quasi-religious revival,
our third Assistant Vice-President is contemplating &mdash;I think that that is
the right word for it&mdash; an Artifical Devotion Department. (Maybe it is only
because his wife presently spends a lot of her time &ldquo;reviving&rdquo;. Before the
AD Department has materialized, she may have lost interest in revivals or
he in her....) In the preparatory stage he has designed Canonical Forms for
the Seven Capital Sins, and you should see them: they are absolute beauties!
It looks very promising, and this could turn into a very interesting daughter
of the company. (End of Secret.)

Dear Edsger,
<p>I was delighted to hear from you after all these years.
My apologies for the delay in replying to your letter, but as you will see, it
had to be forwarded to my new address.
It was indeed fortunate that you should seek my advice,
since my firm represents the International Research Development Corporation.
The IRDC is a well-estab1ished non-profit-sharing corporation which seeks to
assist creative institutions and individuals to obtain real rewards for their
abstract labours. Amongst their clients have been L.D.Vinci, N.Bourbaki, D.Scott,
the Department of Machine Intelligence of the University of Edinburgh and the
publishers of the Vienna Telephone Directory, to name but six.
<p>To my surprise, it would appear from your letter that
Mathematics Inc. has not established a legal department capable of overseeing
the protection and exploitation of its creations, and I would therefore suggest 
that you join forces with IRDC. Contrary to your supposition, recent changes in
patent law have enabled Mathematicians to obtain legal protection for their
Theorems. IRDC are perhaps the first organisation to take full advantage of this
new situation. They have, in conjunction with my firm, started offering their
services to Mathematics-based industrial concerns such as yours, and on occasion
to individual Mathematicians, although the day of the individual Mathematician
is I fear drawing to a close.
<p>I enclose for your information a draft form of the revenue
sharing agreement that IRDC would wish you to accept. You will I believe find the
provisions most reasonable, although I am afraid they cannot undertake any aspect
of the task of theorem maintenance.
<p>Incidentally, although, as you say, it will be necessary
at some stage for you to disclose the Proof of your Theorem, it has become the
fashion to do this by providing what is called an Implementation, which can be
given in such excruciating detail that you need have no fear that your competitors
would find it more profitable to understand the proof than to sign a Royalty
agreement. Thus, our last patent, for one of the gentlemen named above, contained
no fewer than 2973 lemmas, and was based on a novel extension, to three dimensions,
of Petri-Net Theory.
<p>I look forward to hearing from you and to joining you
for dinner at the Bali. My secretary&rsquo;s assistant will make the detailed 
arrangements by telephone.
<center>Yours most sincerely,</center>
