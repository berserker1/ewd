<p>The diameter of a graph is defined as the minimum path length, measured in number of edges, that suffices to connect any two nodes; we confine ourselves to undirected connected graphs with at most 1 edge between any two nodes. Nodes connected by an edge are called each other's neighbours. The degree of a node is defined as the number of edges incident on that node; it equals the number of neighbours of that node. Note that summing the degrees of all nodes yields twice the number of edges.</p>
<p>At the one extreme we have the complete graph: it has the minimum diameter, but the maximum number of edges. At the other extreme we have the string: it has the maximum diameter and the minimum number of edges. We are interested in graphs with modest diameter and modest maximum degree.</p>
<p>A well-known example of such a graph is the <var>n</var>-dimensional "cube": its diameter equals <var>n</var> and so does the degree of each of its 2<sup><var>n</var></sup> nodes. To see this, we identify the nodes with the 2<sup><var>n</var></sup> <var>n</var>-digit binary labels and connect any two labels that differ in exactly 1 digit. Thus each node has <var>n</var> neighbours and, hence, degree <var>n</var>; the length of a shortest path between two such labels equals the number of bit positions in which these labels differ and, hence, the diameter equals <var>n</var>. We shall now construct graphs whose diameter is smaller than the <sup>2</sup>logarithm of the number of nodes while the maximum degree remains at that bound or is decreased as well.</p>
<p>To this end we generalize the solution presented by the hypercube in three different ways.</p>
<p>Firstly, we replace our binary labels by mixed-radix labels, in which one digit, which we denote as "the leading digit", plays a special role. For the purpose of this exposition, we can confine ourselves to labels consisting of a leading <var>x</var>-ary digit followed by <var>k</var> <var>y</var>-ary digits; the graph has then <var>x</var>∙<var>y</var><sup><var>k</var></sup> nodes.</p>
<p>Secondly, the edges correspond to a subset of the pairs of labels that differ in exactly 1 digit. (It is this subsetting that allows the departure from binary digits while keeping the degrees down.) Note that, as in the case of the hypercube, a path consists of a sequence of labels in which each next label differs in exactly 1 digit from its predecessor.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the restriction that on the paths considered each digit position is subjected to at most 1 transition —viz. from source value to target value— is waived for the leading digit.</p>
<p>Our construction has the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>whether two labels differing only in one of the <var>y</var>-ary digits are connected or not depends on the pair of <var>y</var>-ary digits in that position and on the (common) leading digit; the dependence is such that there exists at least one value for the leading digit such that the two labels would be connected; we refer to such a leading digit value as "enabling" the <var>y</var>-ary transition in question;</li>
<li>whether two labels differing only in their leading digits are connected or not depends only on the pair of leading digit values; among the <var>x</var> possible values of the leading digit these connections form a connected graph, to which we shall refer as "the <var>x</var>-ary connectivity".</li>
</ul>
<p>To determine a path from a given source label to a given target label, we determine on the <var>x</var>-ary connectivity a shortest path <var>P</var> from source leading digit to target leading digit, such that each of the at most <var>k</var> <var>y</var>-ary transitions required is enabled by at least one <var>x</var>-ary value on <var>P</var>. We can now effectuate the stepwise transformation from source label to target label by performing (in order) the <var>x</var>-ary transitions of <var>P</var>, interleaved with the required <var>y</var>-ary transitions in such a way that each of the latter is enabled by the leading digit of the intermediate label. As a result, the diameter is at most <var>k</var> + the maximum length of <var>P</var>. (The proviso "at most" has been included because for very few required <var>y</var>-ary transitions the above procedure sometimes does not lead to the shortest path between source and target label; only for very small <var>k</var>, the proviso may not be vacuous.) In the following, <var>L</var> will denote the maximum length of <var>P</var>.</p>
<p>The purpose of the remainder of this note is to show how we can choose the parameters —primarily <var>x</var>, <var>y</var>, <var>k</var>, and the enabling rules— so as to gain on the hypercube.</p>
<p class="noindent">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We begin by exploring the case <var>y</var> = 4 by partitioning the 6 possible <var>y</var>-ary transitions in classes <var>A</var>, <var>B</var>, and <var>C</var> as follows:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="ewd1003_y4.png" width="20%">.</p>
<p class="noindent">The property of this classification is that each <var>y</var>-ary value can be subjected to exactly 1 transition from each class. The fact that we have 3 classes suggests that we consider the case <var>x</var> = 3, with as <var>x</var>-ary connectivity</p>
<p align="center"><img src="ewd1003_x3.png" width="15%">;</p>
<p class="noindent">here each <var>x</var>-ary value has been marked with the class of <var>y</var>-ary transitions it enables. For sufficiently large <var>k</var> , <var>L</var> is 3, and hence the diameter is 3 + <var>k</var>. The degree is for each node 2&nbsp;+&nbsp;<var>k</var>. Compared with the hypercube with 2<sup>5</sup> nodes, the graph with <var>k</var> = 2 has the same diameter (= 5), but more nodes (48 instead of 32) and a lower degree (4 instead of 5). With increasing size, degree and diameter grow for the hypercube twice as fast as for this type of graph. (End of (i).)</p>
<p class="noindent">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now consider <var>y</var> = 4 (with the same classes <var>A</var>, <var>B</var>, and <var>C</var>) and <var>x</var> = 2 The number of classes being one larger than the number of <var>x</var>-ary values, we are led to the <var>x</var>-ary connectivity</p>
<p align="center"><img src="ewd1003_x2_A_BC.png" width="20%">.</p>
<p class="noindent">For <var>k</var> = 1, <var>L</var> equals 2, the diameter equals 3, for 4 nodes the degree is 2 and for the 4 other nodes the degree is 3. Compared with the cube we have saved 2 edges. For even <var>k</var>, we can construct graphs in which each node has the same degree 1 + 1.5∙<var>k</var> by interchanging for half of the <var>y</var>-ary digits the enabling roles of the two <var>x</var>-ary values. For <var>k</var> = 2, this graph has 2 nodes, but diameter and degree both equal to 4 (instead of 5 for the hypercube). Compared with the hypercube, the diameter grows half as fast, the degree with 3/4 of the speed. This example has been included because it illustrates a method for distributing the edges more evenly among the nodes; it does not reduce the total number of edges, nor the diameter, but brings minimum and maximum degree closer to the average degree. (End of (ii).)</p>
<p class="noindent">(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now turn to <var>y</var> = 5. A systematic way of partitioning the 10 possible <var>y</var>-ary transitions in classes <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> is as follows:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="ewd1003_y5.png" width="32%">.</p>
<p class="noindent">Having two classes, we choose <var>x</var> = 2 with the x-ary connectivity</p>
<p align="center"><img src="ewd1003_x2_A_B.png" width="20%">.</p>
<p class="noindent">In general, the diameter is 2 + <var>k</var>, whereas the degree is 1 + 2∙<var>k</var> . Because of the latter factor of 2 —in a label each <var>y</var>-ary digit can be subjected to 2 transitions— and 5 is only a little bit larger than 4 , the gain in degree is not spectacular. (E.g. for <var>k</var> = 4 , we have 1250 nodes, degree 9 and diameter 6, which is a uniform improvement over the hypercube with 1024 nodes.) The construction is of particular interest for the case <var>k</var> = 1: 10 nodes of degree 3, but with diameter only 2 because each disabled <var>y</var>-ary transition can be accomplished by two enabled ones. (This is the famous Peterson Graph.) (End of (iii).)</p>
<p>Before showing a few more graphs, we mention two theorems about possible partionings of <var>y</var>-ary transitions.</p>
<p class="noindent"><u>Theorem 0</u> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For <var>y</var> = 2∙<var>n</var> + 1, the <var>y</var>∙(<var>y</var>–1)/2 <var>y</var>-ary transitions can be partitioned into <var>n</var> classes such that each <var>y</var>-ary value can be subjected to 2 transitions from each class.</p>
<p class="noindent">(This partitioning is a generalization of the one shown under (iii).)</p>
<p class="noindent"><u>Proof</u> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distribute the 2∙<var>n</var> + 1 values evenly along the circumference of a circle. Pairs of values with the same distance belong to the same class; because 2∙<var>n</var> + 1 is odd, each value has the same distance to two other values. (End of Proof.)</p>
<p class="noindent"><u>Theorem 1</u> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For <var>y</var> = 2∙<var>n</var> , the <var>y</var>∙(<var>y</var>–1)/2 <var>y</var>-ary transitions can be partitioned into <var>y</var>–1 classes such that each <var>y</var>-ary value can be subjected to 1 transition of each class.</p>
<p class="noindent">(This partitioning is a generalization of the one shown under (i); it is sometimes referred to as The Tournament Problem.)</p>
<p class="noindent"><u>Proof</u> Place one value at the centre of a circle and distribute the remaining 2∙<var>n</var> – 1 values evenly along the circle's circumference. Draw a line from the centre to one of the values and, in the orthogonal direction, the <var>n</var> – 1 chords that pair the remaining values. The connected pairs belong to the same class; the other classes are obtained by rotation of the line/chords pattern. Because each possible chord length occurs in the pattern, each <var>y</var>-ary value can be subjected to <var>y</var>–1 different transitions, each from a different class. (End of proof.)</p>
<p class="noindent">(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With <var>y</var> = 6, we get, according to Theorem 1, 5 transition classes. Analogously to (ii) we can construct a graph of 2∙6<sup>2</sup> = 72 nodes of degree 1&nbsp;+&nbsp;2&nbsp;+&nbsp;3&nbsp;=&nbsp;6 and of diameter 2&nbsp;+&nbsp;1&nbsp;+&nbsp;1&nbsp;=&nbsp;4. (End of (iv).)</p>
<p>For larger values of <var>y</var>, <var>x</var> = 2 is too small if the degree should not be larger than in the comparable hypercube: with <var>x</var> = 2, each next 7-ary digit gives an average degree increase of (7–1)/2 = 3, but 7&nbsp;&lt; 2<sup>3</sup> .</p>
<p class="noindent">(v)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With <var>y</var> = 7, we get, according to Theorem 0, 3 transition classes. With the <var>x</var>-ary connectivity as in (i) , we get graphs with 3∙7<sup>k</sup> nodes of degree 2&nbsp;+&nbsp;2∙<var>k</var> and with diameter 3&nbsp;+&nbsp;<var>k</var>. (End of (v).)</p>
<p class="noindent">(vi)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For <var>x</var> = 3, <var>y</var> = 10 is interesting. We get —Theorem 1— 9 transition classes, and graphs with 3∙10<sup><var>k</var></sup> nodes of degree 2 + 3∙<var>k</var> and with diameter 3&nbsp;+&nbsp;<var>k</var>, e.g. for <var>k</var>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2:&nbsp;&nbsp;300, 8, and 5 respectively. (Here we have extensively exploited the freedom, illustrated in (ii), of allowing <var>x</var>-ary digit values to enable y-ary transition from several classes as presented by our Theorems.) (End of (vi).)</p>
<p>For <var>x</var> = 4 and <var>x</var> = 5 the following <var>x</var>-ary connectivities are worth considering</p>
<p align="center"><img src="ewd1003_x4_5.png" width="35%">.</p>
where <var>A</var>, <var>B</var>, <var>C</var>, <var>D</var>, and <var>E</var> stand for the (groups of) classes into which the <var>y</var>-ary transitions have been partitioned. They have the property that <var>L</var> = <var>x</var> can be achieved with degree 2. (Achieving <var>L</var> = <var>x</var> for <var>x</var> = 6 requires nodes of degree 3.)
<p class="noindent">(vii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For <var>x</var> = 5, <var>y</var> = 16 we thus generate a class of graphs with 5∙16<sup><var>k</var></sup> nodes of degree 2 + 3∙<var>k</var> and with diameter 5 + <var>k</var>. For larger values of <var>k</var> the gain on the hypercube —both in degree and in diameter— becomes impressive. (So does the size of the graph.) (End of (vii).)</p>
<p>Finally, we mention one further freedom: different <var>x</var>-ary values may enable the same <var>y</var>-ary transition. The 4-ary connectivity</p>
<p align="center"><img src="ewd1003_4ary.png" width="15%">.</p>
gives rise to <var>L</var> = 3. It may be considered as an alternative if three groups <var>A</var>, <var>B</var>, and <var>C</var> are appropriate, but a binary or ternary leading digit is not.
