<p><b>Yet another note about termination</b>.</p>
<p>I had never thought that I would have to write this note, but apparently I have to. In a paper I had written:</p>
<table width="100%">
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="10%"></td>
<td>“For each repetitive process we must have a monotonicity argument on which to base our proof of termination.”</td>
</tr>
</table>
To my utter amazement, the Editor of the journal to which it was submitted. expressed in his letter seven lines of severe doubt about the above statement, ending with: “Perhaps it is true, but it is a rather sweeping claim.” I could only conclude that the need for a monotonicity argument for termination proofs is not the common knowledge I supposed it to be, and that the need, even when stated, is not intuitively obvious to everybody.
<p>Because perhaps my Editor’s hesitation was caused by the nondeterminacy that also played a role in that paper, let us consider the general —and in general nondeterministic— repetitive construct DO:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
<td><b>do</b> B1 → S1 ▯ ... ▯ Bn → Sn <b>od</b> .</td>
</tr>
</table>
On my recent trip through the USSR, Tony Hoare, who is presently more operationally inclined than I, described it as
<table>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
<td>{<b>if</b> B1 →S1 ▯ ... ▯ Bn → Sn <b>fi</b>}* or {IF}*</td>
</tr>
</table>
where with {...}* he meant “as many successive executions as possible”, where the execution of IF is regarded when all the guards are false (<b>non</b> BB). A termination proof for a given state x means that after a finite number of steps —i.e. applications of IF — the state <b>non</b> BB is reached. The actual number of steps may not be determined by x , e.g. <b>do</b> y ≥ 2 → y=: y - 2 ▯ y ≥ 1 → y:= y - 1 <b>od</b> with initially y ≥ 2 ; guaranteed termination for the initial state x , however, means that the <b>maximum number of steps needed</b> is finite. Denoting this maximum number by mn(x) , termination is guaranteed in all points x where mn(x) is finite. Denoting the transformation of the state as effectuated by IF symbolically by x=: F(x) —where F may be a partial function: F(x) need not be defined for states x , in which BB does not hold— it is clear that with the above meaning of mn we <b>must</b> have
<table>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
<td>(mn(x) &gt; 0) ⇒ (mn(F(x)) ≤ mn(x) -1) .</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p class="noindent"><b>Note</b>. If F(x) is a single valued function, the program is deterministic and the maximum number of steps needed is also the actual number of steps needed; and then we have</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
<td>(mn(x) &gt; 0) ⇒ (mn(F(x)) = mn(x) - 1) . (End of note.)</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Hence, for all initial states in which termination is guaranteed to occur, the finite function mn(x) which decreases monotonically by at least one at each application of x:= F(x) exists; conversely: each proof of termination boils down to a proof of the existence of such a monotonically decreasing function.</p>

*</p>
<p>Because my challenged claim is one about all possible arguments for termination, a less operational approach that is directly based on the axiomatic definition of the repetitive construct might be appreciated.</p>
<p>For the repetitive construct DO the predicate transformation —see [1], page 35— is given in terms of the predicate transformation of the corresponding alternative construct IF by</p>
<table width="100%">
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="10%"></td>
<td valign="top">H<sub>0</sub>(R) = R <b>and</b> <b>non</b> BB</td>
<td align="right"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"></td>
<td valign="top">H<sub>k+1</sub>(R) = wp(IF, H<sub>k</sub>(R)) <b>or</b> H<sub>0</sub>(R)</td>
<td align="right">(2)</td>

<tr>
<td valign="top"></td>
<td valign="top">wp(DO, R) = (<u>E</u> k: k ≥ 0: H<sub>k</sub>(R)) .</td>
<td align="right"></td>
</tr>
</table>
From (2) it follows that for i &lt; j we have H<sub>i</sub>(R) ⇒ Hj(R) for all states and all post-conditions R . Proving termination means showing that a point x satisfies wp(DO, T) , i.e. that there exists a value t(x) such that H<sub>k</sub>(T) holds there for all values of k satisfying k ≥ t(x) . As x satisfies an invariant relation, P say, it suffices to prove that

<tr>
<td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
<td>(P <b>and</b> t ≤ k) ⇒ H<sub>k</sub>(T) for all states x</td>
</tr>
</table>
But this is the same formula as on the top of [1], page 42. In view of the fact that (2) <b>defines</b> H<sub>k+1</sub> in terms of H<sub>k</sub> , mathematical induction over k is <b>by</b> <b>definition</b> the only available pattern of reasoning. The argument is carried out in [1], pages 41/42; it shows quite clearly how for the transition from k to k+1 the monotonicity assumption about IF , viz.
