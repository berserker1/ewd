<u>The psychology of the user.</u>
<p>
The following has been written after I had studied the special issue (guest editor: Thomas P. Moran) on &quot;The Psychology of Human-Computer Interaction&quot; of the ACM Computing Surveys 13,1 (March 1981). Out of a sense of duty, I studied this issue with a greater attention than usual, the issue being devoted to a topic I had always ignored happily.
<p>
I found &quot;The Psychological Study of Programming&quot; by B.A. Sheil (Xerox Palo Alto Research Center) a revealing and illuminating article. In his introduction he states about programming methodology &quot;[...] the claims that are made are all basically psychological; that is, that programming done in such and such a manner will be easier, faster, less prone to error, or whatever. [...] However great their appeal, though, the methodological recommendations of computer science should be recognized as <u>empirically testable, psychological hypotheses</u>. Unlike mathematics, literary criticism, or folklore, a discipline of computer science has an obligation to validate these claims.&quot;
<p>
Does it? Fulfilling this obligation seems to me for computing science as hard (or even impossible) as for the rest of mathematics. It is more honest - and, hence, probably wiser - not to make such claims and show one's methodological findings - as in the rest of mathematics! -

on the basis of &quot;Take it or leave it.&quot;. (In this connection I am tempted to add that we had better recognize the scientific community's freedom to teach on that basis. I shudder at the thought of the totalitarian environment in which we may only teach what has been &quot;validated&quot; by the psychologists.)
<p>
That Sheil himself has not challenged the stated obligation is the more amazing since the rest of his article argues that - even to the standards of psychology - the empirical testing done so far is not above criticism and that the psychological hypotheses submitted so far are much too simplistic to be of any relevance for a subtle activity such as programming. In contrast to the quotation from Sheil my conclusion is that &quot;the recommendations of computer science should be recognizable as <u>empirically testable, psychological hypotheses</u> if psychology is to fulfil its scientific promise&quot;. Sheil's article is reasonably well-written.
<p>
So is &quot;Human-Computer Interaction in the Control of Dynamic Systems&quot; by W.B. Rouse. On linguistic grounds I have argued elsewhere - in EWD618 - that &quot;the user&quot; is not a person of flesh and blood, but a literary figure like a caricature; he - or should I say: it? - is an artefact of computing. This is fully confirmed by Rouse's article, largely devoted to user models. For a given

model one can try to maximize the model's satisfaction, motivation, or performance. Functional specification acts as a logical firewall between the concern for correctness - i.e. the question whether a system meets the specification - and the concern for pleasantness - i.e. the question whether a system meeting the specification fits well in the intended environment - . It is a pleasure to see how well W.B. Rouse keeps these two concerns separated: he fully confines himself to concerns for pleasantness. By way of illustration I quote the question he raises in his conclusions: &quot;What fraction of the task responsibility should be allocated to the human (at a particular instant in time) in order to keep him sufficiently involved and motivated [sic!] to perform acceptably over weeks, years, or a whole career?&quot;. His concern is entirely at the other side of the logical firewall, and I cannot even regard it as &quot;a subfield of computer science&quot;. (Rouse's article is so readable because he is quite honest about his pragmatism: &quot;While such explanations may be inadequate in terms of scientific rigor, they can be quite useful as design tools.&quot;. He is from the University of Illinois, Urbana.)

The paper &quot;Human Factors Studies of Database Query Languages&quot; by Phyllis Reisner (IBM Research Laboratory, San Jose) is perhaps best characterized

by the following quotation. &quot;Gould and Ascher [also from IBM, EWD] asked subjects, who were given a problem statement [...], first to write a problem formulation in their own words, then to write a plan to solve it, and then to code it [what?, EWD] in IQF. [...] They found, for example, that whether or not the problem was well expressed seemed to affect problem formulation time, but not [the time taken by?, EWD] the other two stages.&quot; What an amazing finding. Earlier, Reisner devotes almost a column to &quot;procedurality&quot; though &quot;The notion is not clearly defined&quot; and remains that way. The &quot;experiments&quot; described don't seem very relevant to me, the paper is poorly written and I got nothing out of it.
<p>
The paper &quot;Behavioral Aspects of Text Editors&quot; by David W. Embley and George Nagy (both of the University of Nebraska, Lincoln) is long, and contains a lot of information, such as &quot;The standard key size is 0.5 inch (1.27 centimeters) in diameter and the standard horizontal spacing is 0.75 inch (1.81 [sic!] cm).&quot; and &quot;Prolonged use of the light pen was also reported to be fatiguing since the arm cannot rest.&quot;. I don't exclude that the paper is interesting for people interested in such things.
<p>
The paper &quot;The Psychology of How Novices Learn Computer Programming&quot; by Richard E. Mayer (the

University of California, Santa Barbara) closes the issue. For everyone who wants his prejudices against psychologists - or against BASIC, for that matter - reconfirmed, the paper is obligatory reading. His approach to understanding computer programming - and also to teaching it, if he had his way - is fully operational; BASIC's statement &quot;LET X = 5&quot; is explained as a succession of 6 (!) so-called &quot;transactions&quot;, each with three attributes. The paper is 20 pages and almost impossible to plough through.
<p>
The introduction &quot;An Applied Psychology of the User&quot; by T.P. Moran (Xerox Palo Alto Research Center) should be reread when all is over. Its opening sentence &quot;This special issue of Computing Surveys on &quot;The Psychology of the Computer User&quot; [notice the difference, EWD] represents [= presents? EWD] the debut of user psychology, as a coherent subfield of computer science, to the computing community.&quot; is then no longer convincing. Its last section &quot;Status of the Field&quot; is quite sober: &quot;Too much of the reported work on user psychology suffers from sloppy methodology, such as lack of experimental control and overgeneralized interpretation.&quot;. I couldn't agree more.
