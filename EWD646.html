<b>A not so simple theorem about undirected graphs.</b> See pg.2.
<p>(The other day Alain Martin told me that C.S.Scholten had shown him a
rather complicated proof for what seemed a fairly simple theorem, and 
commucated the theorem to me. I felt challenged and tried to find a &ldquo;simple&rdquo; proof
myself. The proof that I found is recorded below, partly because I think my
proof simple enough to have some beauty, partly because perhaps the theorem
is not so simple after all: it took me a full day to prove it and another
five hours to write the following in manuscript.)
<p>In a finite, undirected graph we call two nodes that are directly 
connected by an edge of the graph each other&rsquo;s &ldquo;neighbours&rdquo;. Let P and Q be
two different nodes of the graph. We define a &ldquo;path from P to Q &rdquo; as a
sequence of nodes, starting with P and ending with Q , such that no node
occurs more than once in it and any two adjacent nodes in the sequence are
each other&rsquo;s neighbours in the graph. Of such a path, P and Q are called
&ldquo;the terminal nodes&rdquo;, the ones in between are called &ldquo;the internal nodes&rdquo;.
(If P and Q are not each other&rsquo;s neighbours, a path from P to Q has
at least one internal node.)
<p>The theorem states that for any pair of different nodes A and B that
are not each other&rsquo;s neighbours, there exists a node C that is an internal
node of any path from A to B , or there exists a pair of paths from A to
B that have no internal node in common.
<p>In order to prove it, we arbitrarily select one path from A to B and
call it &ldquo;the special path&rdquo;; its edges are called &ldquo;the special edges&rdquo;, its 
internal nodes are called &ldquo;the special nodes&rdquo;. For brevity&rsquo;s sake we denote on
the special path the direction from A to B as the direction &ldquo;from left to
right&rdquo;.
<p>Next, let P and Q be two non-adjacent nodes of the special path: we
define &ldquo;an external path between P and Q &rdquo; as a path between P and Q
of which no node of the special path is an internal node. If between a P
and a Q of the special path an external path exists, we call the special
nodes between P and Q &mdash;if P is to the left of Q : the special nodes
that are to the right of P and also to the left of Q&mdash; &ldquo;covered&rdquo; by that
external path.
                   
<p>It is clear that a covered special node can never be a candidate for C
an external path allows a path from A to B that bypasses all special nodes
it covers.
<p>There are now two mutually exclusive cases: either there exist one or
more special nodes not covered b an external ath or each special node is
covered by at least one external path.
<p>In the first case the theorem is true, for each path from A to B must
pass through all uncovered special nodes, hence any special node that is not
covered by any external path can be taken as node C.
<p>In the second case the theorem is also true, for if each special node
is covered by at least one external path, two paths from A to B exist that
have no internal node in common. We shall show this existence by construction.
<p>We shall construct a sequence of external paths PQ<sub>0</sub>, PQ<sub>1</sub>, ... , PQ<sub>N</sub> .
The left-hand terminal node of the path PQ<sub>i</sub> will be denoted by P<sub>i</sub> ; the
right-hand terminal node of the path PQ<sub>i</sub> will be denoted by Q<sub>i</sub> . Denoting
the relation &ldquo;to the left of&rdquo; by &ldquo;&lt;&rdquo; our sequence of external paths shall
have the following two properties:
<p class=noindent>Property 1:
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
</td><td>A = P<sub>0</sub> &lt; P<sub>1</sub> &lt; Q<sub>0</sub> &le; P<sub>2</sub> &lt; Q<sub>1</sub> &le; P<sub>3</sub> &lt; Q<sub>2</sub> &le; ..... Q<sub>N-2</sub> &le; P<sub>N</sub> &lt; Q<sub>N-1</sub> &lt; Q<sub>N</sub> = B .
</td>  </tr>  </table>
Property 2:
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
</td><td>For i &ne; j the external paths PQ<sub>i</sub> and PQ<sub>j</sub> have no internal node in
common .
</td>  </tr>  </table>
<p>Because (see property 1) we have for 0 &lt; i &lt; N
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
</td><td>P<sub>i</sub> &lt; Q<sub>i-1</sub> &le; P<sub>i+1</sub> &lt; Q<sub>i</sub> ,
</td>  </tr>  </table>
Q<sub>i-1</sub> and P<sub>i+1</sub> , if not coincident, can be connected via special nodes 
between them on the special path and this entire connection will be covered by
PQ<sub>i</sub>; similarly we connect A with P<sub>1</sub> and Q<sub>N-1</sub> with B .
Then PQ<sub>0</sub>, PQ<sub>2</sub>, PQ<sub>4</sub> ,... and PQ<sub>1</sub>, PQ<sub>3</sub>, PQ<sub>5</sub> supplemented with the
connections introduced in the previous paragraph form two paths from A to
B that have no internal node in common: on account of property 1 they share
 
no special nodes, on account of property 2 they share no non-special nodes
as internal nodes.
<p>For PQ<sub>0</sub> we choose an external path with P<sub>0</sub> = A &mdash;because the 
leftmost special node is covered, such an external path exists&mdash; and Q<sub>0</sub> as far
to the right as possible. If Q<sub>0</sub> coincides with B the construction stops
here, otherwise we proceed repeatedly as follows until an external path PQ<sub>N</sub>
with Q<sub>N</sub> = B has been selected.
<p>Let PQ<sub>i</sub> be the last external path selected and let Q<sub>i</sub> not coincide
with B . Then Q<sub>i</sub> is a special node and, hence, covered by at least one
external path. For PQ<sub>i+1</sub> we choose a path covering Q<sub>i</sub> with Q<sub>i+1</sub> as far
to the right as possible. For i = 0 , the fact that Q<sub>0</sub> &lt; Q<sub>1</sub> and the way
in which PQ<sub>0</sub> has been selected imply P<sub>0</sub> &lt; P<sub>1</sub> ; for i &gt; 0 , the fact
Q<sub>i</sub> &lt; Q<sub>i+1</sub> and the way in which PQ<sub>i</sub> has been selected imply that the path
PQ<sub>i+1</sub> does not cover Q<sub>i+1</sub> and hence we conclude Q<sub>i-1</sub> &lt; P<sub>i+1</sub>, The 
quality P<sub>i+1</sub> &lt; Q<sub>i</sub> follows from the fact that PQ<sub>i+1</sub> covers Q<sub>i</sub> . This
proves the inequalities mentioned in property 1 . Property 2 follows from
the fact that PQ<sub>i+1</sub> has no internal node in common with PQ<sub>k</sub> for 0 &le; k &le; i :
such a common node would provide an external path between Pk and Qi+1 , the
existence of which is not compatible with the construction of Q<sub>k</sub> as a 
rightmost node. And this completes our proof.
<p class=noindent><b>Acknowledgements</b>. I am indebted to C.S.Scholten for having found the theorem,
to Alain Martin for having screened my proof, and to my mother, mrs.B.C.Dijkstra -
Kluyver for having discovered a serious omission in my proof&rsquo;s first 
presentation &mdash;as a matter of fact, the omission was so serious that she did not
believe the proof&mdash; .
<p class=noindent><b>Note</b>. With directed paths A &rarr; B and P &rArr; Q the proof can be applied directly
to the more interesting case of directed graphs.
