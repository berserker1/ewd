<b>On not duplicating volatile information</b>.
<p>In EWD718 I have described the assembly conventions for the EDSAC.
With one aspect of the problem they dealt quite satisfactorily, viz. with
the problem of extracting a sublibrary from the total library of subroutines.
A characteristic of the organization was the introduction of a closed 
nomenclature for the elements of the extracted sublibrary, this in contrast to
the open nomenclature for the elements of the total library. Less 
satisfactory was the free duplication (or the uncontrolled dissipation) of all
sorts of allocation results formed in the various stages of the assembly
process.
<p>In the EDSAC organization one could get away with the crude solution
of duplication thanks to a number of simplifying circumstances. I mention
the following ones:
<br>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Always the whole machine was allocated to the execution of a single
program; as a result it sufficed to have an organization that could embed
the assembled program in that fixed and constant environment as provided by
&ldquo;the machine&rdquo;.
<br>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The machine was &ldquo;simple&rdquo; in that it had only a one-level store in
which each location was as good as any other.
<br>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main components of the assembly &mdash;master routine and library 
subroutines&mdash; were &ldquo;simple&rdquo; in the sense that they were components of a 
constant size that was well-known in advance.
<p class=noindent>In short: the problem of duplicated volatile information was avoided by not
introducing volatility. In this note we shall attempt a more systematic
study of the ways in which duplicated volatile information can be avoided:
we can try to avoid either volatility, or duplication!
<p>A crucial observation is that some duplications are unavoidable, at
least if we accept as dogma the purpose of creating an environment from
which the open nomenclature that covers the whole library has disappeared.
A program may call explicitly the library subroutines A and B , both of
             
which may need library subroutine C ; in that case the preset parameters
of A as well as those of B will contain a reference to C . As the
dogma excludes the use of the library name of C in those preset 
parameters, a local terminology has to be duplicated.
<p>Because we want to avoid the duplication of volatile information,
these multiple references to C must be in a nomenclature that we can 
afford to keep constant. In the EDSAC conventions we have seen two techniques.
Without the assembly routine M1 the programmer had to decide the storage
layout once and for all, and the references to C in the preset parameters
of A and B would be in terms of the address of C&rsquo;s &ldquo;first instruction&rdquo;.
with the assembly routine M1 the preset parameters of A and B could
refer to C in terms of its &ldquo;ordinal number&rdquo;. The latter has the advantage
that then the references are independent of the lengths of subroutines (as
implied by their allocation in store).
<p>If we take a program as the unit of assembly, we are allowed to take
each subroutine&rsquo;s ordinal number in that program as providing a sufficiently
constant nomenclature that we may duplicate in the preset parameters.
<p>Having thus avoided duplication of first addresses of subroutines on
the input tape we should explore what would be involved in keeping them 
volatile. The answer is simple: don&rsquo;t copy them, neither during program 
assembly, nor during program execution. Still confining ourselves to the 
situation in which the complete machine is at a single program&rsquo;s disposal, we
come to the following machinery during program execution.
<p>To start with we would need &mdash;with apologies for the acronym&mdash; a 
program routine table PRT with an entry for each ordinal number used in the
program; each entry will &ldquo;lead to&rdquo; &mdash;and here I have intentionally used a
vague terminology&mdash; the corresponding routine&rsquo;s current &ldquo;address of first
instruction&rdquo;.
<p>The program routine table PRT is needed to call a routine: given
the routine&rsquo;s ordinal number it will provide the current address of the 
                   
routine&rsquo;s first instruction, an address that is needed for the selection of
the next instruction to be executed. The access to PRT in order to 
process the ordinal number of the called routine introduces some overhead on
the procedure call; as soon as the routine has been called, however, its
successive instructions can be selected with full speed as before, if we
maintain the EDSAC&rsquo;s &ldquo;instruction counter&rdquo; as the register containing the
address of the location containing the next instruction to be executed.
<p>Note, however, that maintaining such an instruction counter is a 
dangerous thing to do: upon subroutine call it is filled with a <b>copy</b> of &ldquo;the
address of the routine&rsquo;s first instruction&rdquo;, information that we wanted to
keep volatile! We must keep such an undesirable copy under strict control;
I suggest that we do not allow further copies of it to be made. This implies
that we must provide an alternative for the EDSAC way of supplying at 
subroutine call the return information. Instead of copying the contents of the
instruction counter &mdash;i.e. supplying the current address of the call&mdash; we
must supply a non-volatile characterization of the place of the call. 
Within the context of the program such a non-volatile characterization is 
provided by the ordinal number of the calling routine, together with the cell&rsquo;s
position relative to the location of the calling routine&rsquo;s first instruction.
From the need to provide such non-volatile return information we deduce that
in addition to PRT the machinery requires a further status variable, CRN
say, for the &ldquo;Current Routine Number&rdquo;. In the subroutine call CRN is 
redefined and set to the ordinal number of the routine called, while its old
value is saved in the return information; upon return from the subroutine
it is reset to the ordinal number of the calling routine, whose execution is
continued. (The status variable CRN can be viewed as a non-volatile 
extension of the instruction counter.)
<p>So much for not duplicating addresses of first instructions. What
about the ordinal numbers? As long as each single program has the whole
machine at its disposal and can be regarded as a unit of assembly, the 
situation is relatively simple.
<p>On the final tape each library subroutine is punched in terms of closing
              
    letters and preceded by control combinations that define the preset 
parameters in terms of ordinal numbers that are substitued for the closing
letters during the input of the program. As a result the subroutine call
as stored contains, just as the return jump generated during program 
execution, the ordinal number of the target routine. The entries of the PRT
contain for each routine the address of its first instruction.
<p>An alternative would have been not to process the preset parameters
during program input by substituting them for the closing letters, but to
store them in little tables. one for each subroutine. We might call them
SCLT&rsquo;s, short for Subroutine Closing Letter Tables. The SCLT belonging
to a subroutine would contain an entry for each closing letter used in the
subroutine; each entry would mention the ordinal number of the subroutine
corresponding to the closing letter in question. Each PRT-entry would
lead, besides to the address of the subroutines first instruction, to its
SCLT, e.g. by mentioning the latter&rsquo;s starting address. The bit patterns
representing the library bodies are now allowed to contain their original
closing letters; during program execution each closing letter can be 
translated into the corresponding ordinal number because the current SCLT can
be accessed because its starting address can be found in the PRT under
control of the current routine number&rsquo; CRN . (This would be a second use
of the status variable CRN .)
<p>The second alternative has been mentioned, not because it is 
particularly attractive, but because the first alternative &mdash;substituting the 
ordinal numbers all through the binary texts&mdash; does not work as soon as we
would like to store several programs simultaneously, but in such a way that
they can share the bit patterns of library subroutines used by several of
them. The ordinal numbers supply <b>per program</b> a closed terminology for the
library subroutines used in that very same program. The sublibraries 
extracted for the different programs will, in general, overlap only partly;
it is, in general, therefore unavoidable that the same library subroutine
will be denoted in different programs by different ordinal numbers. In the
case of simultaneously stored programs sharing the bit patterns of common
library subroutines the first alternative therefore doesn&rsquo;t work.
                   
<p>In order not to complicate matters still further we shall assume from
now on that the mutual dependence of library subroutines as to be catered
for by program assembly is fixed by (the current state of) the library, i.e.
we now disregard the form of programmer control over the assembly process as
mentioned in the Note on pg. EWD718 - 7. Under that assumption the mutual
dependence of the library subroutines is fully determined by the union of
the subroutines possibly needed by each of the programs. For the sake of
the argument I assume that that union is still a small fraction of the total
library, small enough, in any case, to justify extraction and introduction
of a &ldquo;union nomenclature&rdquo; that only covers the union of the library routines
possibly needed by the currently loaded programs.
<p>The fact that we have to play a new sort of game may dawn upon us as
soon as we realize that. without renumbering, it is impossible to keep the
union nomenclature fully closed. When only the first program is loaded the
union nomenclature can be kept closed. When the second program is loaded in
addition to the First, we can still keep the union nomenclature closed by
assigning the next numbers to the further library subroutines needed by the
second program. Because at the moment of the loading of the first program
it was unknown which library procedures it would share with the second 
program, gaps in the union nomenclature must be expected when the execution of
the first program terminates before the execution of the second program does
so. By always assigning in the case of extension the first currently free
number &mdash;&ldquo;trying to fill the left-most gop&rdquo;&mdash; we seem to do the best we can
do when we wish to keep the nomenclature as well closed as possible: thus
the maximum value assigned never exceeds the union&rsquo;s maximum size in the
past. In this case I think that the first free number strategy is quite 
acceptable and I assume in the sequel that it has been adopted for the union
nomenclature.
<p>It stands to reason to expect, analogously to the PRT for each 
program, for the installation as a whole a URT , short for Union Routine Table,
with an entry for each routine of the library that may be needed by at least
one of the programs currently loaded. In contrast to the PRT&rsquo;s, the URT
need not be fully closed: in the middle of it we may have entries marked:
                          
&ldquo;currently free&rdquo;. While a member of the union of selected subroutines, each
subroutine has a constant &ldquo;union number&rdquo;, which acts as the selector for its
entry in the URT
<p>Again we have essentially two choices for the bit pattern to be stored.
In the one case we regard the union nomenclature sufficiently constant to
allow its duplication. The role of the PRT in uniprogramming is fully
taken over by the URT , and all programs and all subroutines refer to the
subroutines in terms of union numbers. The machine needs the status variable
CRN as before, the only difference being that its contents is now 
interpreted as union number, the ordinal numbers having disappeared from the
scene. Also all return information is represented in terms of union numbers.
A consequence is that when the same program is loaded at two different 
occasions, the bit patterns representing the program at those two occasions
will differ from each other, the union numbers used being all different.
Such free duplication of union numbers makes the internal representation of
each program dependent on the environment in which it happens to be embedded,
and I do not regard that as very attractive: such an organization really
forces us to treat union numbers used by a program as non-volatile during its
complete execution.
<p>Suppose now that in our multiprogramming environment we would like to
be able to interrupt a program execution, but in such a way that an 
interrupted computation can be resumed at a later stage, say a week or a month
later. Suppose, furthermore, that during the interruption the installation
proper must be able to shed the interrupted computation completely, i.s. all
information pertaining to the interrupted computation will be dumped on an
external medium &mdash;a magnetic tape, say&mdash; and the installation proper must be
allowed to continue operating fully independently of the fact that there 
exists an interrupted computation to be resumed at some later moment. Well,
that implies that we cannot allow the interrupted program to &ldquo;reserve&rdquo; union
numbers: upon resumption it has to refer to the library subroutines in a
different union nomenclature. In other words, we now have to consider the
union nomenclature as volatile and, therefore, have to ask ourselves how its
free duplication can be avoided.
                     
<br><p>We can solve the problem by a proper combination of the machinery 
considered previously, extended with one status variable (which is really a
consequence of the transition from uni- to multiprogramming); I shall call
this status variable CPR , short for &ldquo;Current Program Reference&rdquo;. In the
order of increasing multiplicity, the machinery consists of the following
components.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Remark</b>.  Duplication of ordinal numbers occurs, but is restricted: a
routine&rsquo;s ordinal number in this program occurs in one SCLT-entry for each
subroutine selected for this program that refers to it; furthermore ordinal
numbers are duplicated in the return information. (End of Remark.)

<p>The bit patterns representing the library routine bodies contain their
original closing letters. The closing letters provide a terminology local
to the binary text, which is translated via an SCLT in the terminology local
to the program in which the routine is invoked; via a PRT this terminology
local to the current program is translated into the union nomenclature. (Note
how the PRT is determined by the current program, and the SCLT by the 
current program/routine combination.)
<p>It first sight it seems a tortuous way of doing. Consider a library
routine A with union number UA , calling a library routine C with union
number UC . Let A be called from two programs in which it has the ordinal
numbers OA1 and OA2 respectively, and in which the library routine C
has the ordinal numbers OC1 and OC2 respectively. The closing letter
under which the binary text of A refers to C has always to lead to UC,
but the &mdash;technical trouble in the typewriter continued 
in handwriting&mdash; path along which depends on the identity 
of the current program: with OAi selecting in PRTi 
the SCLT is found that contains the entry OCi; with 
OCi selecting in PRTi we get UC. The point is 
that besides UC,  which may <b>not</b> be duplicated, we 
need OCi as well, namely for the return information 
and for the setting of CRN.
<p class=noindent><b>Remark.</b> In the meantime the flexibility mentioned 
in the note on page EWD718-7 is back again (End of Remark.)
<p class=noindent><b>Historical Note</b>. The last organisation described is 
much more ambitious than I dared to consider while
designing the THE multiprogramming system in the 
mid-sixties. The problem of sublibrary selection 
was avoided by always storing the complete library, 
which was not very big, in the installation 
proper, which, thanks to its drum, had a store 
that, at the time, was considered large.
<p>Information to be stored was subdivided into 
so called pages of 512 consecutive numbered 
words; during its lifetime each page was identified 
by a unique bit pattern, thus providing a 
global nomenclature, which was freely duplicated 
all through the system. As a result the library 
was very hard to change; even extending it was 
not simple.
<p>Furthermore it had to be a so called "load-and-go" 
system: during program compilation one 
or more page frames in core would be allocated 
to the programme for the course of its entire execution 
and the numbers of these frames would be freely duplicated 
all of the object text! Later we had 
many occasions to regret our loss of flexibility.
(End of historical note.)
<p class=noindent><b>Remark.</b> In the last arrangement the duplication 
of union numbers if so modest that renumbering 
can be considered. As a result the could remain 
a closed terminology. (End of remark.) 
<p align="center" class="noindent">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>*</p> 
<p>While carrying out the above analysis I was 
pleasantly surprised when observing how clear 
the guidance was that came from the combination 
of the two design principles &mdash;avoid the frequent 
processing of open nomenclatures and avoid the 
duplication of volatile information&mdash;. The principles 
themselves are not very surprising, but their combination 
is surprisingly effective. 
<p>A final remarks should be made. What should be 
regarded as "volatile" or as "non-volatile"  greatly 
depends on the envisaged way of using the installation: 
remember that union numbers should be 
regarded as volatile when we want to remove 
interrupted computations from the instalation proper
in such a way that they can be resumed later. 
But observe the influence on the proposed machinery. 
This was an influence at quite a detailed 
level. It gives an indication why machine design 
is so hard. I think I would be willing defend 
the last argument, even if it turns out that 
no one wishes to interrupt computations. Just to 
be safe!
