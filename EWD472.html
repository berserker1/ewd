<p class="noindent"><b>Abstract</b>. So-called &ldquo;guarded commands&rdquo; are introduced as a building block
for alternative and repetitive constructs that allow non-deterministic
program components for which at least the activity evoked, but possibly
even the final state, is not necessarily uniquely determined by the initial
state. For the formal derivation of programs expressed in terms of these
constructs, a calculus will be shown.

<p class="noindent"><b>Guarded commands, non-determinacv and formal derivation of programs.</b>
<p>1. <b>Introduction</b>.
<p>In section 2, two statements, an alternative construct and a 
repetitive construct will be introduced, together with an intuitive (mechanistic)
definition of their semantics. The basic building block for both of them
is the so-called &ldquo;guarded command&rdquo;, a statement list prefixed by a boolean
expression: only when this boolean expression is initially true, is the
statement list eligible for execution. The potential non-determinacy
allows us to map otherwise (trivially) different programs on the same
program text, a circumstance that seems largely responsible for the fact that
now programs can be derived in a more systematic manner then before.
<p>In section 3, after a prelude defining the notation, a formal 
definition of the semantics of the two constructs will be given, together with
two theorems for each of the constructs (without proof).
<p>In section 4, it will be shown, how upon the above a formal calculus
for the derivation of programs can be founded. We would like to stress
that we do not present &ldquo;an algorithm&rdquo; for the derivation of programs: we
have used the term &ldquo;a calculus&rdquo; for a formal discipline &mdash;a set of rules&mdash;
such that, if applied successfully
<br>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it will have derived a correct program
<br>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it will tell us that we have reached such a goal.
(We use the term as in &ldquo;integral calculus&rdquo;.)
<p>2. <b>Two statements made from guarded commands</b>.
<p>If the reader accepts &ldquo;other statements&rdquo; as indicating, say,
assignment statements and procedure calls, we can give the relevant syntax
in BNF [2]. In the following we have extended BNF with the convention
that the braces &ldquo;{...}&rdquo; should be read as: &ldquo;followed by zero or more
instances of the enclosed&rdquo;.
<p class=p0>&lt; <var>guarded command</var> &gt; ::= &lt; <var>guard</var> &gt; &rarr; &lt; <var>guarded list</var> &gt;</p>
<p class=p0>&lt; <var>guard</var> &gt; ::= &lt; <var>boolean expression</var> &gt;     </p>
<p class=p0>&lt; <var>guarded list</var> &gt; ::= &lt; <var>statement</var> &gt; {; &lt; <var>statement</var> &gt;}       </p>
<p class=p0>&lt; <var>guarded command set</var> &gt; ::= &lt; <var>guarded command</var> &gt; {&#x25af; &lt; <var>guarded command</var> &gt;} </p>
<p class=p0>&lt; <var>alternative construct</var> &gt; ::= <b>if</b> &lt; <var>guarded command set</var> &gt; <b>fi</b>  </p>
<p class=p0>&lt; <var>repetitive construct</var> &gt; ::= <b>do</b> &lt; <var>guarded command set</var> &gt;<b>od</b>   </p>
<p class=p0>&lt; <var>statement</var> &gt; ::= &lt; <var>alternative construct</var> &gt; | &lt; <var>repetitive construct</var> &gt; |
                          &ldquo;<var>other statements</var>&rdquo; .         </p>
<p>The semicolons in the guarded list have the usual meaning: when the
guarded list is selected for execution its statements will be executed 
successively in the order from left to right; a guarded list will only be
selected for execution in a state such that its guard is true. Note that
a guarded command by itself is <b>not</b> a statement: it is a component of a
guarded command set from which statements can be constructed. If the
guarded command set consists of more than one guarded command, they are
mutually separated by the separator &ldquo;&#x25af;&rdquo; ; our text is then an arbitrarily
ordered enumeration of an unordered set, i.e. the order in which the guarded
commands of a set appear in our text is semantically irrelevant.
<p>Our syntax gives two ways for constructing a statement out of a
guarded command set. The alternative construct is written by enclosing
it by the special bracket pair: <b>if</b> ... <b>fi</b>&ldquo;. If in the initial state none
of the guards is true, the program will abort, otherwise an arbitrary
guarded list with a true guard will be selected for execution.
<p class="noindent"><b>Note</b>. If the empty guarded command set were allowed &rdquo;<b>if</b> <b>fi</b>&ldquo; would be
semantically equivalent to &rdquo;abort&ldquo; . (End of note.)
<p>An example &mdash;illustrating the non-determinacy in a very modest fashion&mdash;
would be the program that for fixed x and y assigns to m the maximum
value of x and y :
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td colspan = 2>
    <b>if</b> x &ge; y &rarr; m:= x </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>&nbsp; </td> <td>
     &#x25af; y &ge; x &rarr; m:= y </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td colspan = 2>
    <b>fi</b>     .                 </td> </tr>
</table>
<p>The repetitive construct is written down by enclosing a guarded
command set by the special bracket pair <b>do</b> ... <b>od</b>&rdquo; . Here a state in
which none of the guards is true will not lead to abortion but to proper
termination; the complementary rule, however, is that it will only terminate
in a state in which none of the guards is true: when initially or upon
completed execution of a selected guarded list one or more guards are true,
a new selection for execution of a guarded list with a true guard will take
place, and so on. When the repetitive construct has terminated properly,
we know that all its guards are false.
<p class="noindent"><b>Note</b>. If the empty guarded command set were allowed &ldquo;<b>do</b> <b>od</b>&rdquo; would be
semantically equivalent to &ldquo;skip&rdquo; . (End of note.)
<p>An example &mdash;showing the non-determinacy in somewhat greater glory&mdash;
is the program that assigns to the variables q1, q2, q3 and q4 a permutation
of the values Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4, such that q1 &le; q2 &le; q3 &le; q4 . Using
concurrent assignment statements for the sake of convenience, we can program
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td colspan = 2>
   q1, q2, q3, q4 := Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4;    </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td colspan = 2>
   <b>do</b> ql > q2 &rarr; ql, q2 := q2, ql </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>&nbsp; </td> <td>
    &#x25af; q2 > q3 &rarr; q2, q3 := q3, q2 </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td>
    &#x25af; q3 > q4 &rarr; q3, q4 := q4, q3 </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td colspan = 2>
   <b>od</b>                            </td> </tr>
</table>
<p>To conclude this section we give a program where not only the computation
but also the final state is not necessarily uniquely determined. The program
should determine k such that for fixed value n (n &gt;0) and a fixed
function f(i) defined for O &le; i &lt; n , k will eventually satisfy:
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
     0 &le; k &lt; n  <b>and</b> (&#x2200;i: 0 &le; i &lt; n: f(k) &ge; f(i))            </td> </tr>
</table>
(Eventually k should be the place of at maximum.)
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td colspan = 3>
     k:= 0; j:= 1;                                                       </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td colspan = 3>
     <b>od</b> j &ne; n &rarr; <b>if</b> f(j) &le; f(k) &rarr; j:= j + 1 </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td>&nbsp; </td> <td>
                 &#x25af; f(j) &ge; f(k) &rarr; k:= j; j:= j + 1         </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td colspan = 2>
                <b>fi</b>                                                </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td colspan = 3>
     <b>od</b>                                                           </td> </tr>
</table>
<p>Only permissible final states are possible and each permissible final
state is possible .
<p><b>3. Formal definition of the semantics</b>.
<p><b>3.1. Notational prelude. </b>
<p>In the following sections we shall use the symbols P, Q and R
to denote (predicates defining) boolean functions defined on all points of
the state space; alternatively we shall refer to them as &ldquo;conditions&rdquo;,
satisfied by all states for which the boolean function is true. Two special
predicates that we denote by the reserved names &ldquo;T&rdquo; and &ldquo;F&rdquo; play a
special role: T denotes the condition that, by definition, is satisfied
by all states, F denotes, by definition, the condition that is satisfied
by no state at all.
<p>The way in which we use predicates (as a tool for defining sets of
initial or final states) for the definition of the semantics of programming
language constructs has been directly inspired by Hoare [1], the main
difference being that we have tightened things up a bit: while Hoare
introduces sufficient pre-conditions such that the mechanisms will not
produce the wrong result (but may fail to terminate), we shall introduce
necessary and sufficient &mdash;i.e. so-ca1led &ldquo;weakest&rdquo;&mdash; pre-conditions such
that the mechanisms are guaranteed to produce the right result.
<p>More specifically: we shall use the notation &ldquo;wp(S, R)&rdquo;, where S
denotes a statement list and R some condition on the state of the system,
to denote the weakest pre-condition for the initial state of the system such
that activation of S is guaranteed to lead to a properly terminating
activity leaving the system in a final state satisfying the post-condition
R . Such a &ldquo;wp&rdquo; &mdash;which is called &ldquo;a predicate transformer&rdquo;, because it
associates a pre-condition to any post-condition R &mdash; has, by definition,
the following properties .
<p class="noindent">
1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For any S, we have for all states
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
            wp(S, F) = F </td> </tr>
</table>
(the so-called &ldquo;Law of the Excluded Miracle&rdquo;).
<br>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For any S and any two post-conditions, such that for all states
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
            P &rArr; Q </td> </tr>
</table>
we have for all states
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
            wp(S, P) &rArr; wp(S, Q) . </td> </tr>
</table>
3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For any S and any two post-conditions P and Q we have for all
states      
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
           (wp(S, P) <b>and</b> wp(S, Q)) = wp(S, P <b>and</b> Q). </td> </tr>
</table>
4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For any deterministic S and any post-conditions P and Q we have for
all states
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
           (wp(S, P) <b>or</b> wp(S, Q)) = wp(S, P <b>or</b> Q) . </td> </tr>
</table>
For non-deterministic mechanisms S the equality has &ldquo;to be replaced by an
implication; the resulting formula follows from the second property.
<p>Together with the rules of propositional calculus and the semantic
definitions to be given below, the above four properties take over the
role of the &ldquo;rules of inference&rdquo; as introduced by Hoare [1].
<p>We take the position that we know the semantics of a mechanism S
sufficiently well if we know its predicate transformer, i.e. can derive
wp(S, R) For any post-condition R.
<p class="noindent"><b>Note</b>. We consider the semantics of S only defined for those initial states
for which has been established a priori that they satisfy wp(S, T), i.e.
for which proper termination is guaranteed (even in the face of possibly
non-deterministic behaviour); for other initial states we don&rsquo;t care. By
suitably changing S, if necessary, we can always see to it that wp(S, T)
is decidable.(End of note.)
<p class="noindent"><b>Example 1</b>. The semantics of the empty statement, denoted by &rsquo;&ldquo;skip&rdquo;, are
given by the definition that for any post-condition R, we have
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
          wp(&ldquo;skip&rdquo;, R) = R . </td> </tr>
</table>
<p class="noindent"><b>Example 2</b>. The semantics of the assignment statement &ldquo;x:= E&rdquo; are
given by 
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
          wp(&ldquo;x:= E&rdquo;, R) = R<sub>E</sub><sup>x</sup> </td> </tr>
</table>
in which R<sub>E</sub><sup>x</sup> denotes a copy of the predicate defining R in which each
occurence of the variable x is replaced by &ldquo;(E)&rdquo;.
<p class="noindent"><b>Example 3</b>. The semantics of the semicolon &ldquo;;&rdquo; as concatenation operator
are given by
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
    wp(&ldquo;S1; S2&rdquo;, R) = wp(S1, wp(S2, R)) . </td> </tr>
</table>
<p><b>3.2. The alternative construct</b>.
<p>In order to define the semantics of the alternative construct we
define two abbreviations.
Let &ldquo;IF&rdquo; denote      
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
                <b>if</b> b<sub>1</sub> &rarr; SL<sub>1</sub> &#x25af; ... &#x25af; B<sub>n</sub> &rarr; SL<sub>n</sub> <b>fi</b>  ; </td> </tr>
</table>
let &ldquo;BB&rdquo; denote 
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
                (&#x2203;i: 1 &le; i &le; n: B<sub>i</sub>)  ; </td> </tr>
</table>
then, by definition
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
      wp(IF, R) = (BB <b>and</b> (&#x2200;i: 1 &le; i &le; n: B<sub>i</sub> &rArr; wp(SL<sub>i</sub>, R)) . </td> </tr>
</table>
<p class="noindent">(The first term &ldquo;BB&rdquo; requires that the alternative construct as such will
not lead to abortion on account of all guards false, the second term
requires that each guarded list eligible for execution will lead to an
acceptable final state.) From this definition we can derive &mdash;by simple
substitutions&mdash;
<p class="noindent"><b>Theorem 1</b>. From
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
      (&#x2200;i: 1 &le; i &le; n: (Q <b>and</b> B<sub>i</sub>) &rArr; wp(SL<sub>i</sub>, R)) for all states </td> </tr>
</table>
we can conclude that
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
      (Q <b>and</b> BB) &rArr; wp(IF, R) holds for all states . </td> </tr>
</table>
<p>Let &ldquo;t&rdquo; denote some integer function, defined on the state space,
and let &ldquo;wdec(S, t)&rdquo; denote the weakest pre-condition such that activation
of S is guaranteed to lead to a properly terminating activity leaving the
system in a final state such that the value of t is decreased by at
least 1 (compared to its initial value). In terms of &ldquo;wdec&rdquo; we can 
formulate the very similar
<p class="noindent"><b>Theorem 2</b>. From .
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
      (&#x2200;i: 1 &le; i &le; n: (Q <b>and</b> B<sub>i</sub>) &rArr; wdec(SL<sub>i</sub>, t)) for all states </td> </tr>
</table>
we can conlude that
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
      (Q <b>and</b> BB) &rArr; wdec(IF, t) holds for all states. </td> </tr>
</table>
<b>Note</b> (which can be skipped at first reading). The relation between &ldquo;wp&rdquo;
and &ldquo;wdec&rdquo; is as follows. For any point X in state space we can regard
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
      wp(S, t &le; t0) </td> </tr>
</table>
as an equation with t0 as the unknown. Let its smallest solution for t0
be tmin(X). (Here we have added the explicit dependence on the state X.)
Then tmin(X) can be interpreted as the lowest upper bound for the final
value of t if the mechanism S is activated with X as initial state.
Then, by definition,
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
      wdec(S, t) = (tmin(X) &le; t(X) - 1) = (tmin(X) &lt; t(X)) . </td> </tr>
</table>
(End of note.)
<p><b>3.3. The repetitive construct</b>.
<p>As is to be expected, the definition of the repetitive construct
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
            <b>do</b> b<sub>1</sub> &rarr; SL<sub>1</sub> &#x25af; ... &#x25af; B<sub>n</sub> &rarr; SL<sub>n</sub> <b>od</b> </td> </tr>
</table>
that we denote by &ldquo;DO&rdquo;, is more complicated.
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=15%>
Let</td><td>H<sub>0</sub>(R) = (R <b>and</b> <b>non</b> BB)
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>
and for k &gt; 0:</td><td>H<sub>k</sub>(R) = (wp(IF, H<sub>k-1</sub>(R)) <b>or</b> H<sub>0</sub>(R))
</td>  </tr>  </table>
(where &ldquo;IF&rdquo; denotes the <b>same</b> guarded command set enclosed by &ldquo;<b>if</b> <b>fi</b>&rdquo;)
then, by definition
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
               wp(DO, R) =(&#x2203k: k &ge; 0: H<sub>k</sub>(R))   . </td> </tr>
</table>
(Intuitively, H<sub>k</sub>(R) can be interpreted as the weakest pre-condition 
guaranteeing proper termination after at most k selections of a guarded list,
leaving the system in a final state satisfying R .) Via mathematical
induction we can prove
<p class="noindent"><b>Theorem 3.</b> If we have for all states
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
               (P <b>and</b> BB) &rArr; (wp(IF, P) <b>and</b> wdec(IF, t) <b>and</b> t &ge; 0) </td> </tr>
</table>
we can conclude that we have for all states
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
               P &rArr; wp(DO, P <b>and</b> <b>non</b> BB) . </td> </tr>
</table>
Note that the antecedent of Theorem 3 is of the form of the consequents of
Theorems 1 and 2.
<p>Because T is the condition by definition satisfied by all states,
wp(S, T) is the weakest pre-condition guaranteeing proper termination for
S . This allows us to formulate an alternative theorem about the repetitive
construct, viz.
<p class="noindent"><b>Theorem 4.</b> From
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
               (P <b>and</b> BB) &rArr; wp(IF, P) for all states, </td> </tr>
</table>
we can conclude that we have for all states
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
               (P <b>and</b> wp(DD, T)) &rArr; wp(DO, P <b>and</b> <b>non</b> BB) . </td> </tr>
</table>
In connection with the above theorems &ldquo;P&rdquo; is called &ldquo;the invariant relation&rdquo;
and &ldquo;t&rdquo; is called &ldquo;the variant function&rdquo;. Theorems 3 and 4 are easily
proved by mathematical induction, with k as the induction variable.
<p><b>4. Formal derivation of programs</b>.
<p>The formal requirement of our program performing &ldquo;m:= max(x, y)&rdquo;
&mdash;see above&mdash; is that for fixed x and y it establishes the relation
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
R:</td><td>(m = x <b>or</b> m = y) <b>and</b> m &ge; x <b>and</b> m &ge; y .
</td>  </tr>  </table>
<p>Now the Axiom of Assignment tells us that &ldquo;m:= x&rdquo; is the standard
way of establishing the truth of &ldquo;m = x&rdquo; for fixed x, which is a way
of establishing the truth of the first term of R. Will &ldquo;m:= x&rdquo; do the
job? In order to investigate this, we derive and simplify
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td colspan = 2>
     wp(&ldquo;m:= x&rdquo;, R) = (x = x <b>or</b> x = y) <b>and</b> x &ge; x <b>and</b> x &ge; y </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
                    = x &ge; y   .                                                                </td> </tr>
</table>
Taking this weakest pre-condition as its guard, Theorem 1 tell us that
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
     <b>if</b> x &ge; y &rarr; m:= x <b>fi</b> </td> </tr>
</table>
will produce the correct result if it terminates succesfully. The 
disadvantage of this program is that BB &ne; T, i.e. it might lead to abortion;
weakening BB means looking for alternatives which might introduce new
guards. The obvious alternative is the assignment &ldquo;m:= y&rdquo; with the guard
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
      wp(&ldquo;m:= y&rdquo;, R) = y &ge; x       ; </td> </tr>
</table>
so
thus we are led to our program
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td colspan = 2>
               <b>if</b> x &ge; y &rarr; m:= x </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>&nbsp; </td> <td>
                &#x25af; y &ge; x &rarr; m:= y </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td colspan = 2>
               <b>fi</b>                       </td> </tr>
</table>
and by this time BB = T and therefore we have solved the problem. (In
the mean time we have proved that the maximum of two values is always
defined, viz. that R considered as equation for m has always a
solution.)
<p>As an example of the deriviation of a repetitive construct we shall
derive a program for the greatest common divisor of two positive numbers,
i.e. for fixed, positive X and Y we have to establish the final relation
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
          x = gcd(x, v) . </td> </tr>
</table>
<p>The formal machinery only gets in motion, once we have chosen our
invariant relation and our variant function. The program then gets the
structure &ldquo;establish the relation P to be kept invariant&rdquo;;
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td colspan = 2>
          <b>do</b> &ldquo;decrease t as long as possible onder invariance </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
             of P&rdquo; <b>od</b> .                                       </td> </tr>
</table>
<p>Suppose that we choose for the invariant relation
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
P:</td><td>gcd(X, Y) = gcd(x, y) <b>and</b> x &gt; O <b>and</b> y &gt; 0
</td>  </tr>  </table>
a relation that has the advantage of being easily established by
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
         x:= X; y:= Y . </td> </tr>
</table>
<p>The most general &ldquo;something&rdquo; to be done under invariance of P is
of the form                           
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
                 x, y:= E1, E2 </td> </tr>
</table>
and we are interested in a guard B such that
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td colspan = 2>
     (P <b>and</b> B) &rArr; wp(&ldquo;x, y := E1, E2&rdquo;, P)                     </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
               = (gcd(X, Y) = gcd(E1, E2) <b>and</b> E1 &gt;0 <b>and</b> E2 &gt;0) . </td> </tr>
</table>
<p>Because the guard must be a computable boolean expression and should
not contain the computation of gcd(X, Y) &mdash;for that was the whole problem!&mdash;
we must see to it that the expressions E1 and E2 are so chosen. that
the first term
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
         gcd(X, Y) = gcd(E1, E2) </td> </tr>
</table>
is implied by P, which is true if
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
         gcd(x, y) = gcd(E1, E2) . </td> </tr>
</table>
In other words we are invited to massage the value pair (x, y) in such
a fashion that their gcd is not changed. Because &mdash;and this is the place
at which to mobilize our mathematical knowledge about the gcd-function&mdash;
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
         gcd(x, y) = gcd(x - y, y) </td> </tr>
</table>
a possible guarded list would be
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
         x:= x - y . </td> </tr>
</table>
Deriving
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
      wp(&ldquo;x:= x - y&rdquo;, P) = (gcd(X, Y) = gcd(x - y, y) <b>and</b> x - y &gt; 0 <b>and</b> y &gt; 0) </td> </tr>
</table>
and omitting all terms of the conjunction implied by P we find the guard
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
            x &gt; y </td> </tr>
</table>
as far as the invariance of P is concerned. Besides that we must require
guaranteed decrease of the variant function t . Let us investigate the
consequences of the choice
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
            t = x + y   . </td> </tr>
</table>
From                              
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
            wp(&ldquo;x:= x - y&rdquo;, t &le; t0) =                 </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>
            wp(&ldquo;x:= x - y&rdquo;. x + y &le; t0) = (x &le; t0) </td> </tr>
</table>
we conclude that .
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
            tmin = x    ; </td> </tr>
</table>
therefore 
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
            wdec(&ldquo;x:= x - y&rdquo;, t) = (x &lt; x + y) = (y &gt; 0) . </td> </tr>
</table>
<p>The requirement of monotonic decrease of t imposes no further   
restriction of the guard because wdec(&ldquo;x:= x - y&rdquo;, t) is fully implied
by P and we come at our first effort  
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
            x:= X; y:= Y;                                   </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>
            <b>do</b> x &gt; y &rarr; x:= x - y <b>od</b> . </td> </tr>
</table>
<p>Alas, this single guard is insufficient: from P <b>and</b> <b>non</b> BB we
are not allowed to conclude x = gcd(X, Y). In a completely analogous
manner, the alternative y:= y - x will require as its guard y &gt; x
and our next effort is
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td colspan = 2>
            x:= X; y:= Y;                       </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td colspan = 2>
            <b>do</b> x &gt; y &rarr; x:= x - y </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>&nbsp; </td> <td>
             &#x25af; y &gt; x &rarr; y:= y - x </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td colspan = 2>
            <b>od</b>   .                       </td> </tr>
</table>
<p>Now the job is done, because with this last program <b>non</b> BB = (x = y)
and (P <b>and</b> x = y) &rArr; (X = gcd(X, Y) because gdc(x, x) = x .
<p class="noindent"><b>Note</b>. The choice of t = x +2y and the knowledge of the fact that the
gcd is a symmetric function could have led to the program
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td colspan = 2>
          x:= X; y:= Y;                       </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td colspan = 2>
          <b>do</b> x &gt; y &rarr; x:= x - y </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>&nbsp; </td> <td>
           &#x25af; y > x &rarr; x, y:= y, x  </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td colspan = 2>
          <b>od</b> .                         </td> </tr>
</table>
The swap &ldquo;x, y := y, x&rdquo; can never destroy P : the guard of the last
guarded list is fully caused by the requirement that t is effectively
decreased.
<p>In both cases the final game has been to find a large enough set of
such guarded lists that BB, the disjunction of their guards, was 
sufficiently weak: in the case of the alternative construct the purpose is
avoiding abortion, in the case of the repetitive construct the goal is
getting BB weak enough such that P <b>and</b> <b>non</b> BB is strong enough to
imply the desired post-condition R .
<p>It is illuminating to compare our first version of Euclid&rsquo;s 
Algorithm with what we would have written down with the traditional clauses;
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
     x:= X; y:= Y; (version A)                                                                                          </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>
     <b>while</b> x &ne; y <b>do</b> <b>if</b> x &gt; y <b>then</b> x:= x - y <b>else</b> y:= y - x <b>od</b> <b>od</b> </td> </tr>
</table>
and
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td colspan = 3>
     x:= X; y:= Y; (version B)                                                                                          </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td colspan = 3>
     <b>while</b> x &ne; y <b>do</b> <b>while</b> x > y <b>do</b> x:= x - y <b>od</b> ;                                 </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
                    <b>while</b> y > x <b>do</b> y:= y - x <b>od</b>                                                    </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td colspan = 2>
                 <b>od</b>                                                                                              </td> </tr>

<p class="noindent">In the fully symmetric version with the guarded commands the algorithm has
been reduced to its bare essentials, while the traditional clauses force
us to choose between versions A and B (and others), a choice that can
only be justified by making assumptions about the time taken for tests and
about expectation values for traversal frequencies. (But even taking the
time taken for tests into account, it is not clear that we have lost: the
average number of necessary tests per assignment ranges with guarded commands
from 1 to 2, equals 2 for version A and ranges from 1 to 2.5 for
version B. If the guards of a guarded command set are evaluated concurrently
&mdash;nothing in our semantics excludes that&mdash; the new version is time-wise
superior to all the others.) The virtues of the <b>case</b>-construction have
been extended to repetition as well.
<p>5. <b>Concluding remarks.</b>
<p>The research, the outcome of which is reported in this article, was
triggered by the observation that Euclid&rsquo;s Algorithm could also be regarded
as synchronizing the two cyclic processes &ldquo;<b>do</b> x:= x - y <b>od</b>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<b>do</b> y:= y - x <b>od</b>&rdquo;
in such a way that the relation x &gt; 0 <b>and</b> y &gt; 0 would be kept invariantly
true. It was only after this observation that we saw that the formal
techniques we had already developed for the derivation of the synchronizing
conditions that ensure the harmonious co-operation of (cyclic) sequential
processes, such as can be identified in the total activity of operating
systems, could be transferred lock, stock and barrel to the development
of sequential programs as shown in this article. The main difference is
that while for sequential programs the situation &ldquo;all guards false&rdquo; is a
desirable goal &mdash;for it means termination of a repetitive construct&mdash;,
one tries to avoid it in operating systems &mdash;for there it means deadlock.
<p>The second reason to pursue these investigations was my personal
desire to get a better appreciation, which part of the programming activity
can be regarded as a formal routine and which part of it seems to require
&ldquo;invention&rdquo;. While the design of an alternative construct now seems to be
a reasonably straightforward activity, that of a repetitive construct 
requires what I regard as &ldquo;the invention&rdquo; of an invariant relation and a
variant function. My presentation of this calculus should, however, not
be interpreted as my suggestion that all programs should be developed in
this way: it just gives us another handle.
<p>The calculus does, however, explain my preference for the axiomatic
definition of programming language semantics via predicate transformers
above other definition techniques: the definition via predicate transformers
seems to lend itself most readily to being forged into a tool for the 
goaldirected activity of program composition.
<p>Finally I would like to add a word or two about the potential 
nondeterminacy. Having worked mainly with hardly self-checking hardware, with
which non-reproducing behaviour of user programs is a very strong indication
of a machine malfunctioning, I had to overcome a considerable mental 
resistance, before I found myself willing to consider non-deterministic programs
seriously. It is, however, fair to say that I could never have discovered
the calculus before having taken that hurdle: the simplicity and elegance
of the above would have been destroyed by requiring the derivation of
deterministic programs only. Whether non-determinacy is eventually removed
mechanically &mdash;in order not too mislead the maintenance engineer&mdash; or 
(perhaps only partly) by the programmer himself because, at second thought,
he does care &mdash;e.g. for reasons of efficiency&mdash; which alternative is
chosen, is something I leave entirely to the circumstances. In any case
we can appreciate the non-deterministic program as a helpful 
steppingstone.
