			<p><u>Claim</u> We consider a partitioning of the squares of a chessboard into 32 pairs of adjacent squares, and call each pair a domino. A domino whose squares are in the same row we call a horizontal domino. We claim that the number of horizontal dominoes with a black left square and the number of horizontal dominoes with a white left square are equal. [Corollary: the number of horizontal dominoes is even.]
</p>
			<p class="noindent"><u>Proof</u> For a given partitioning, consider one of the seven lines that separate two adjacent columns; it divides the board into a left and a right part. We observe that</p>
			<ol>
				<li type="i">because the column length is even, each column, and hence the left part, contains equal numbers of black and white squares, and<br/>
							<br/>
						</li>
				<li type="i">because a domino consists of a black and a white square, the dominoes entirely to the left of the line comprise equal numbers of black and white squares.</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="noindent">Combining the two observations, we conclude that, among the horizontal dominoes crossed by the line, there are as many with a black left square as with a white one. Since each horizontal domino is crossed by exactly one of the seven lines, we conclude by summation that the number of horizontal dominoes with a black left square and the number of horizontal dominoes with a white left square are equal.</p>
