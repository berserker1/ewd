<p class=noindent><b>A correctness proof for communicating processes: a small exercise</b>.
         
<p>Over the last one-and-a-half year C.A.R.Hoare has explored &ldquo;communicating
sequential processes&rdquo;, among many other targets as a means for describing
&ldquo;elephants built from mosquitoes, all humming in harmony&rdquo;, to quote the old
metaphor. His approach has two main characteristics to be described now.
<br>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called &ldquo;marriage bureau coupling&rdquo;. Inspired by our familiarity
with the assignment statement, he has decided to try to visualize in- and output
as the two sides of an assignment statement. In the one mosquito the input
command assigns a value to one of its &mdash;by definition!&mdash; private variables, in
the other mosquito the matching output command provides the value to be assigned.
In the implementation these in- and output commands are supposed to prescribe
an implicit synchronization: they are viewed as completed simultaneously. (This
is in accordance with our earlier impression, viz. that &ldquo;mutual coincidence&rdquo;
is in such an environment a more essential notion than &ldquo;mutual exclusion&rdquo;.)
<table width=100%>

<p class=noindent>Note that the program text for mosquito &ldquo;x&rdquo; mentions the sender &ldquo;y&rdquo; in its
input command &ldquo;y?(a)&rdquo;, and that in the text for mosquito &ldquo;y&rdquo; the receiver &ldquo;x&rdquo;
is mentioned in its output command &ldquo;x!(E)&rdquo; .
<p class=noindent>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each pair of mosquitoes is connected via at most a <b>single</b> channel that
accommodates two-way traffic. This imposes an ordering in time of the acts of
communication between any two mosquitoes. It was felt that this would simplify
the mathematical treatment.
<p align="center" class="noindent">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>*</p> 
<p>We embarked upon one of a series of examples of communicating sequential
processes solving a sorting problem suggested by Wim H.J.Feijen. Two mosquitoes
each start with a &ldquo;bag of natural numbers&rdquo; &mdash;the difference between a &ldquo;bag&rdquo; and
a &ldquo;set&rdquo; being that in a bag not all elements need to be different from each

other&mdash; . Mosquito x removes the maximum value from its bag and sends it to
mosquito y , which adds it to its bag; this is followed by a transmission by y
to x of the minimum element taken from the bag of y , etc. Eventually x
ends up with the small elements in its bag and E with the large ones.
<p>Our aim was to investigate to what extent the two mosquitoes could be
successfully investigated in isolation. We wrote down texts for both mosquitoes,
and then covered the one text with a piece of paper. I now simulate that by
first only giving you the text for mosquito x (with many notational liberties
of which I hope that they won&rsquo;t confuse you; &#x2241; and &#x2243; stand for addition to
and removal from bags).    
<p class=noindent>Mosquito x:
<table> <tr> <td colspan = 3>

      s:= 5 {the constant 5 is a non-empty bag <b>of</b> nat}; p:= max(s); </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td colspan = 2>
      y!(P); r:= s &#x2243; p:                                             </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td colspan = 2>
      y?(a); s:=  r &#x2241; a;                                            </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td colspan = 2>
      p:= max(s) {P};                                                      </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td colspan = 2>

         y?(a); s:= r &#x2241; a;                                          </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td>
         p:= max(s) {P}                                                    </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td colspan = 2>
      <b>od</b>                                                            </td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan = 3>
<b>end</b>                                                                 </td> </tr>
</table>
<p>With sum(bag) = the sum of the numbers contained in &ldquo;bag&rdquo;, we have as
the relevant invariant relation for the <b>do</b>...<b>od</b>:
<table> <tr> <td>
P = (sum(s) = sum(r) + a) <b>and</b> p = max(s) &ge; a . </td> </tr>
</table>
The first equality is established after s:= r &#x2241; a , the inequality p &ge; a
is established by p:= max(s) , because max(s) &ge; any element in s and the
element &ldquo;a&rdquo; is in s.
<p>We choose for the variant function sum(r):
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
      wdec(&ldquo;r:= s &#x2243; p&rdquo;, sum(r)) = sum(s &#x2243; p) &lt;sum(r) : </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>
      sum(s) - p &lt; sum(r) = {on account of P}                                    </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>
      sum(r) + a - p &lt; sum(r) = p &gt; a  .                                      </td> </tr>
</table>
Hence the guard &ldquo;p &gt; a&rdquo; guarantees effective decrease of sum(r).

Because natural numbers are bounded from below,  
sum(r) is so too, and mosquito x terminates. In its final state it has 
established (P and p &le; .a) , which implies max(s) = a , i.e. the final value
of &ldquo;a&rdquo; occurs in the bag &ldquo;s&rdquo; and is the largest value in that bag.
<p class=noindent>(If the value(s) of &ldquo;a&rdquo; would not be bounded from below, termination, indeed,
cannot be guaranteed. 1 shall not pursue that now, because proofs of nontermination
are a different story.)
<p align="center" class="noindent">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>*</p> 
<p>We now turn our attention to mosquito y .
<table> <tr> <td colspan = 3>

      t:= T {the constant T is a nonempty bag <b>of</b> nat}; </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td colspan = 2>

      <b>do</b> x?(b) &rarr; u:= t &#x2241; b;                </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
         q:= min(u);                                          </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td>
         x!(q); t:= u &#x2243; q {Q}                          </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td colspan = 2>

</table>
<p>The &ldquo;query guard&rdquo; x?(b) is regarded to have the side-effect of assigning
a value to b when evaluating to true &mdash;as a matter of fact, the value 
transmitted by the matching y!(p) in mosquito x , but the discussion of this
interaction is postponed, as well as the discussion of how a happening in 
mosquito x can cause the query guard x?(b) to become false&mdash; . The invariant
relation Q for y&rsquo;s repetitive construct that interests us is
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
      Q = q &le; min(t) </td> </tr>
</table>
We have wp(&ldquo;t:= u &#x2243; q&rdquo;,Q) = q &le; min(u &#x2243; q) ; because min(u &#x2243; q) &ge; min(u),
the previous weakest pre-condition is implied by q = min(u) , a relation which
is established by q:= min(u) . In short: when mosquito y has terminated, it
has established q &le; min(t) , i.e. all elements in the bag t are greater than
or equal to the final value of q (the final value of q need not occur in the
bag t ).                
<p align="center" class="noindent">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>*</p>   
<p>The proofs, so far, have surprised us in two respects. First of all: when
we started we did not know that the weakest condition on the input stream of the
a&rsquo;s for termination of x would be that the a&rsquo;s are bounded from below and
<b>nothing</b> else . (I believe that intuitively I felt, that the sequence of a&rsquo;s
being non-increasing had something to do with it; quod non.) Secondly, we
feared another complication when we started: mosquito x terminates when 
otherwise it would send a value p = to the value &ldquo;a&rdquo; just received. This value has been
transmitted once &mdash;if originally in T &mdash; or twice &mdash;if originally in S &mdash; , and
for that reason we expected that we would have to distinguish between those two
cases. (Trying to live with sum(s) as variant function would have introduced
similar problems.) In our treatment the distinction between those two cases has
disappeared completely &mdash;I even hope that some of my readers did not realize this
distinction before I pointed it out to them!&mdash; , and that is probably the most
pleasant and encouraging gain that we derived from dealing with our mosquitoes
in isolation. By now we have studied them to such an extent in isolation, that
time has come to study the combination.
<p>There are a few rules of the game: input/output command sequences at both
sides of a channel must match, i.e. for an input command at the one side of the
channel we must have a matching output command at the other side. Well, in this
simple example, this is OK, in the sense that the sequence of channel commands
in x are given by the syntax &mdash;with {...} denoting zero or more instances
of the enclosed&mdash;
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
          y!(p) y?(a) {y!(p) y?(a)} </td> </tr>
</table>
and in mosquito y by
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
          x?(b) x!(q) {x?(b) X!(q)} . </td> </tr>
</table>
Ignoring the arguments p , a , b , and q , the one syntax can be transformed
into the other by interchanging x and y and also interchanging ? and ! .
Hence, both syntaxes contain matching sentences, and the whole thing will match,
provided that from both syntaxes &rdquo;the same&ldquo; sentence is chosen. In this case
the choice of sentence is restricted to the length: both mosquitoes must 
terminate at the same stage.
<p>It seems very tricky if separate termination proofs for both mosquitoes
must be given, with in addition a proof that they will terminate after the same
amount of traffic. (Not impossible, but tricky.) One of the rules of the game
 
is that when one of the mosquitoes decides on account of its internal logic
&mdash;such as x in this example&mdash; to quit, that this can result in &ldquo;disappearance
of the channel&rdquo; &mdash;e.g. by a block exit, not indicated in the text on pg-EWD607 - 1&mdash;
and that disappearance of the channel will cause at the other side communication
commands in a guard position &mdash;such as the (second) x?(b) in the text for y &mdash;
to give rise to a false guard. Tony seems to have chosen for an asymmetry here:
only &ldquo;query guards&rdquo; are allowed in his proposal. Although the decision is
defensible, for the time being we would also like to allow&ldquo;exclamation guards&rdquo;:
termination because the receiving and decides that it has had enough! (Sorry for
the very operational terminology.) In view of the symmetry between in- and output,
this greater freedom does not seem to create much complication. With such an
implicit convention for termination, the communication sequences at both ends
are now forced to match. (The match can even be decided on purely syntactic
grounds; we hope that this will always be the case.)
<p>Associating with y!(p) the implicit assignment pp:= pp &#x2241; p (on the
&ldquo;ghost bag&rdquo; pp, which is initialized empty), and similarly with a &ldquo;ghost bag&rdquo;
aa, associating with y?(a) thereafter aa:= aa &#x2241; a , we can strengthen P
with
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
        s = S &#x2241; aa &#x2243; pp </td> </tr>
</table>
similarlyy Q can be strengthened with the relation
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
        t = T &#x2241; bb &#x2243; qq . </td> </tr>
</table>
Taking the arguments in our matching syntaxes into account, a postulate about
the communication must enable us to identify p with b , hence pp with bb
and a with q, hence aa with qq . And thus we find firstly s &#x2241; t = S &#x2241; T
i.e. conservation of elements. But it also allows us to equate the <b>final</b> value
of &ldquo;a&rdquo; with the <b>final</b> value of &ldquo;q&rdquo; , this combining from the two final states
rnax(s) = a = q gmin(t) ;
thus the correctness of the elephant has been established.
