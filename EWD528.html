<p class=noindent><b>More on Hauck&rsquo;s warning.</b>
<p>In EWD525 &ldquo;On a warning from E.A.Hauck&rdquo; I mentioned without proof that
with n=2<sup>m</sup> bit there exist 2<sup>n-m-1</sup> different messages &mdash;I called them
&ldquo;codes&rdquo;, but that is an unusual terminology for which I apologize&mdash; , such
that any two different messages differ in at least four bit positions, thus
allowing correction of one-bit errors and detection of two-bit errors. Since
then I have been shown a proof of that theorem; I report that proof because
it is so nice, and because it gives some further insights.
<p>For the sake of brevity I shall demonstrate the theorem for 16:24 bits
(in a way which is readily generalized for other values of m ). We consider
16 bits numbered from 0 through 15 , writing their index in binary:
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
      d<sub>0000</sub>, d<sub>0001</sub>, d<sub>0010</sub>, d<sub>0011</sub>, ..., d<sub>1111</sub> </td> </tr>
</table>
With &ldquo;xxx1&rdquo; we denote the set of odd indices, with &ldquo;xx1x&rdquo; the set {0010, 0011,
0110, 0111, 1010, 1011, 1110, 1111}, in general the set obtained by all
possible substitutions of a 0 or a 1 at a place marked &ldquo;x&rdquo;, and define
<br>h0 = parity(d<sub>xxx1</sub> ) , h1 = parity(d<sub>xx1x</sub> ) , h2 = parity(d<sub>x1xx</sub> ) , h3 = parity(d<sub>1xxx</sub> )
<br>   
where the function &ldquo;parity&rdquo; is = 0 if among the (8) bits with an index from
the indicated set, the number of 1&rsquo;s is even, and = 1 if it is odd. Further
we introduce h = parity(d<sub>xxxx</sub>) , which is just the sum of all the 16 bits
modulo 2.
<p>The 2<sup>11</sup> correct messages are then characterized by the equations
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
        h0 = h1 = h2 = h3 = h = 0 . </td> </tr>
</table>
<b>Note</b>. The above equations have indeed 2<sup>11</sup> different solutions: the 11 bits
d<sub>3</sub>, d<sub>5</sub>, d<sub>6</sub>, d<sub>7</sub>, d<sub>9</sub>, d<sub>10</sub>, d<sub>11</sub>, d<sub>12</sub>, d<sub>13</sub>, d<sub>14</sub>, and d<sub>15</sub> can be chosen freely,
we then solve h0 for d<sub>1</sub>, h1 for d<sub>2</sub>, h2 for d<sub>4</sub>, and h3 for d<sub>8</sub>, and finally
h for d<sub>0</sub> .
<p>We now denote by &ldquo;a&rdquo; the binary number formed by &ldquo;h3 h2 h1 h0&rdquo; and
observe:
<br>0)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for each correct message we have
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;h = 0, a = 0
<br>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for a one-bit error at bit position i we have
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;h = 1, a = 1
<br>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for a two-bit error at bit positions i and j
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;h = 0, a = the bit-wise sum of i and j
<br>(because i &ne; j , we conclude that a &ne; 0, thereby distinguishing this case
from a correct message)
<br>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for a three-bit error at positions i , j , and k
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;h = 1, a = the bit-wise sum of i , j , and k.
<br>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for a four-bit error at positions i , j , k , and l
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;h = 0, a = the bit-wise sum of i , j , k , and l .

<p>Under the assumption that one- and two-bit errors are the <b>only</b> errors
that can occur, the rules are
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=20%>
h = 0 and a = 0:</td><td>accept the bit sequence
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>
h = 1 :</td><td>invert bit d<sub>a</sub>
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>
h = 0 and a &ne; 0:</td><td>alarm, as two-bit error has been detected.
</td>  </tr>  </table>
<p>From the above, however, we see that all errors in 3, 5, 7, ... bits
will then erroneously be interpreted as one-bit errors, i.e. in those cases
our error correction indeed increases the probability of a wrong result being
produced as if it were a correct one. The above gives a clear demonstration
of the possible &ldquo;harmfulness&rdquo; of error correction alluded to in EWD525&rsquo;s
last paragraph. Hence this note.
