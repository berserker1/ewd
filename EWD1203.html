				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By mathematical induction over the plurals. Consider plural <var>n</var>. Either <var>n</var> is prime, in which case it has the prime divisor <var>n</var>, or it is composite, in which case it has a smaller plural divisor <var>x</var> which (because <var>x</var> &lt; <var>n</var>) has &quot;ex hypothese&quot; a prime divisor that (since <var>x</var> divides <var>n</var>) is a prime divisor of <var>n</var> as well. (End of Proof.)<br />

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	  The above is a nice example of what is sometimes called
	  &quot;course-of-values induction&quot;, in which the proof

				<p>The above has been written down so that we may compare it
	with how Mark Kac and Stanslaw M. Ulam treat the matter on the
	1st page of Chapter 1 of their &quot;Mathematics and
	Logic&quot;:</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p class="noindent"><a name="quote1" id="quote1"></a>
	  The following proof, probably still the simplest, asserts
	  the mere existence of arbitrarily large primes.  Suppose the
	  number were finite; there would then be a largest
	  prime <var>p</var>.  Consider now the number <var>n</var>
	  = <var>p</var>! + 1 (<var>p</var>! is read &quot;<var>p</var>
	  factorial&quot; and equals 1 &#x2219; 2 &#x2219; 3 &#x2026; <var>p</var>).  This number is not divisible by any
	  prime up to <var>p</var>.  If there is no prime between <var>p</var>
	  and <var>n</var>, as we have assumed, then <var>n</var> itself would
	  be prime, contrary to our assumption that <var>p</var> is the
	  largest one.
</p></blockquote>
				
					
				<p>The authors hesitate between dealing with the number of
	primes and the value of primes: the first sentence deals with
	their values, the second one mentions their number.  The
	conclusion of the second sentence is unwarranted: suppose
	there were no primes at all, then their number would have been
	finite (viz. zero), but there would not have been a largest
	prime <var>p</var>.  (I would like the reader to appreciate that
	the argument in our proof of <a href="#lemma1">Lemma 1</a> is perfectly valid when <var>S</var> is empty.) The second sentence would have been better had they just written: &quot;Suppose there were a largest prime <var>p</var>.&quot;.</p>
				<p>The third sentence introduces <var>n</var>, the fourth sentence
	is the first one whose correctness depends on the concept
	&quot;prime&quot;.  Unfortunately, the authors opened their
	chapter a little earlier with:</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p class="noindent"><a name="quote2" id="quote2"></a>
	  1.&nbsp;&nbsp;<var>The Infinity of Primes</var><br />
						
					
	  Among the so-called natural numbers (1, 2, 3, and so on) are
	  some that are divisible only by 1 and by themselves; these are
	  called the <var>prime numbers</var>.  The prime numbers are the
	  building blocks of all the numbers in the sense that every
	  natural number is the product of powers of the primes that
	  divide it.  For instance 60 = 2<sup>2</sup>&#x2219;3&#x2219;5. The first several primes are 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17. It can be asked whether the series goes on forever, or, in other words, whether there is a largest prime. The answer is that there is no largest prime. This has been known since the golden age of Greece. It was proved by Euclid in the 3rd century B.C. His argument is as clear and fresh today as ever.</p></blockquote>
				
					
				So, 1 is included in their primes, and the conclusion in their fourth sentence is just wrong. [This is another illustration of the fact that including 1 among the prime numbers is an unfortunate interface.]
				<p>The fifth sentence is supposed to conclude the proof, but
	it is very elliptic as it does not mention which property of
	prime numbers should justify the conclusion.  It looks as if
	we are invited to conclude from the fact that none of the
	numbers between <var>p</var> and <var>n</var> is prime that none of
	these numbers divides <var>n</var>, and I hope that we are not supposed to use that &quot;Every natural number is the product of [positive] powers of the primes that divide it&quot;, for otherwise we could apply the possibility of that factorization to <var>n</var> directly and conclude, without the
	assumption that <var>p</var> was the largest prime,
	because <var>n</var> &#x2265; 2 the existence of a prime larger
	than <var>p</var>.  The last step of the <a href="#quote1">quoted
	proof</a> needs a possibly unstated and in any case unproven
	lemma (whose proof almost certainly requires mathematical
	induction).  What an awful mess!  And that in a book with the
	title &quot;Mathematics and Logic&quot;!</p>
				<p>Now we are at it, I draw the reader's attention to the
	following sentence from the <a href="#quote2">second
	quotation</a>:</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p class="noindent">
					
	  &quot;It can be asked whether the series [of primes] goes on
	  forever, or, in other words, whether there is a largest
	  prime.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
				However, the answer to the first question is &quot;yes&quot;, and to the second one &quot;no&quot;.
