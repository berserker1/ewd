  <h1>The river, the isles and the bridges</h1>
  <div class='body'>

<P>In a river lie 6 isles, connected by 13 bridges to each other and the shores as follows:</P>

<CENTER><img alt="diagram showing 6 isles in two rows of 3, rows parallel to the stream" border="0" src="EWD1301_figs/EWD1301-1.png" width="319" height="142"></CENTER>

<P style="text-indent: 0">When in a storm each bridge has a probability 1/2 of being swept away.  What is the probability
that the shores remain connected?</P>

<CENTER><PRE>

</PRE></CENTER>

<P>We propose to associate the 13 bridges with the 13 squares in the following array</P>

<CENTER><img border="0" src="EWD1301_figs/EWD1301-2.png" alt="fig.0: diamons in rows of length 3, 2, 3, 2, 3; top vertices labeled A, bottom B, left C, right D" width="369" height="329"></CENTER>
<CENTER>fig.0</CENTER>
<P style="text-indent: 0">such that the original bridges correspond to the diagonals between the marked corners of the 
squares.</P>

<P>In each square we connect with probability 1/2 either</P>
				<table width="85%" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="0">
					<tr>
						<td width="10%">(i)</td>
						<td> the marked corners by a solid diagonal:</td>
						<td><img src="EWD1301_figs/EWD1301-3.png" alt="solid diagonal running northwest-southeast" width="80" height="88"></td>

								or</div>

					</tr>
				</table>
				<P style="text-indent: 0"></P>
				<P style="text-indent: 0">In the new terminology, we are now asking for the probability that there exists a solid path 
between the As and the Bs.</P>
				<P>Paths being continuous we conclude</P>

<P>(As and Bs are connected by a solid path)<br>
					&#x2262;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Cs and Ds are connected by a dotted path)</P>

<P style="text-indent: 0">and hence</P>

<P style="text-indent: 0">(0) &nbsp;&nbsp;the probability that As and Bs are connected<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;= &nbsp;&nbsp;the probability that Cs and Ds are not connected.</P>

<P>From the symmetry of fig. 0 and the equal probabilities of (i) and (ii) we conclude</P>

<P style="text-indent: 0">(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;the probability that Cs and Ds are not connected<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;= &nbsp;the probability that As and Bs are not connected.</P>

<P style="text-indent: 0">Combining (0) and (1) we conclude that the As and Bs are as likely to be connected as to be
disconnected.  The answer we were looking for is therefore &#x00BD;   .</P>

<P style="text-indent: 0"><U>Remark</U> The answer is not surprising since &#x00BD; is also the answer in the situations</P>

<P>I learned this problem early June from Dr. Georg Zimmermann at a workshop "Sprache und 
Mathematik" that the Fachschaft Mathematik of the Bisch&#x00F6;fliche Studienf&#x00F6;rderung "Cusanuswerk" had 
organized in Uder.  We solved the problem at the next session of the ETAC ( = Eindhoven Tuesday
Afternoon Club); in particular the contribution of Frans van der Sommen is acknowledged.</P>

<P>And then it took me almost a month to find the time and muster the energy to record the solution.  
Besides the usual excuses of having other things to do, there was the fact that I still had to 
invent fig. 0, an invention that helped me &#x2014;I think!&#x2014; in my exposition, but also annoyed me because 
I needed pencil and paper for it.</P>
				<P>Eventually I concluded that I did not like the problem too much:  its solution remained an 
isolated ingenuity.</P>
