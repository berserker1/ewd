  <h1>The river, the isles and the bridges</h1>
  <div class='body'>
<p>In a river lie 6 isles, connected by 13 bridges to each other and the shores as follows:</p>
<center><img alt="diagram showing 6 isles in two rows of 3, rows parallel to the stream" border="0" src="EWD1301_figs/EWD1301-1.png" width="319" height="142"></center>
<p style="text-indent: 0">When in a storm each bridge has a probability 1/2 of being swept away. What is the probability that the shores remain connected?</p>

<p>We propose to associate the 13 bridges with the 13 squares in the following array</p>
<center><img border="0" src="EWD1301_figs/EWD1301-2.png" alt="fig.0: diamons in rows of length 3, 2, 3, 2, 3; top vertices labeled A, bottom B, left C, right D" width="369" height="329"></center>
<center>fig.0</center>
<p style="text-indent: 0">such that the original bridges correspond to the diagonals between the marked corners of the squares.</p>
<p>In each square we connect with probability 1/2 either</p>
<table width="85%" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="0">
<tr>
<td width="10%">(i)</td>
<td>the marked corners by a solid diagonal:</td>

<td width="10%">(ii)</td>
<td>the unmarked corners by a dotted diagonal</td>

</table>

<p style="text-indent: 0">In the new terminology, we are now asking for the probability that there exists a solid path between the As and the Bs.</p>
<p>Paths being continuous we conclude</p>
<p>(As and Bs are connected by a solid path)<br>
≢&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Cs and Ds are connected by a dotted path)</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0">and hence</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0">(0) &nbsp;&nbsp;the probability that As and Bs are connected<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;= &nbsp;&nbsp;the probability that Cs and Ds are not connected.</p>
<p>From the symmetry of fig. 0 and the equal probabilities of (i) and (ii) we conclude</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0">(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;the probability that Cs and Ds are not connected<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;= &nbsp;the probability that As and Bs are not connected.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0">Combining (0) and (1) we conclude that the As and Bs are as likely to be connected as to be disconnected. The answer we were looking for is therefore ½ .</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0"><u>Remark</u> The answer is not surprising since ½ is also the answer in the situations</p>

<p>I learned this problem early June from Dr. Georg Zimmermann at a workshop "Sprache und Mathematik" that the Fachschaft Mathematik of the Bischöfliche Studienförderung "Cusanuswerk" had organized in Uder. We solved the problem at the next session of the ETAC ( = Eindhoven Tuesday Afternoon Club); in particular the contribution of Frans van der Sommen is acknowledged.</p>
<p>And then it took me almost a month to find the time and muster the energy to record the solution. Besides the usual excuses of having other things to do, there was the fact that I still had to invent fig. 0, an invention that helped me —I think!— in my exposition, but also annoyed me because I needed pencil and paper for it.</p>
<p>Eventually I concluded that I did not like the problem too much: its solution remained an isolated ingenuity.</p>
