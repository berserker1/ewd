<p>Gentlemen,</p>
<p>I would like to acquire --and I trust that this is a wish you applaud-- a first-class electric typewriter that enables me to produce my technical notes, reports and scientific articles in what is now known as "camera-ready" form.</p>
<p>After having spent the major part of a day calling or visiting the major typewriter shops of Austin, Texas, I decided to contact you directly, for what those shops could provide was useless as far as I am concerned. And I hate to think that the typewriter industry is unable to produce a typewriter I could use, the more so as my wishes --well within the technology of today-- seem as modest as reasonable.</p>
<p>As a mathematician/computing scientist, I need besides the 52 letters, the 10 digits, and the usual interpunction signs a bunch of special characters. The total number of symbols is less than 100 and would fit on a single daisy wheel. And with a very few exceptions my special characters are not so very special either in the sense that they can be found on some daisy wheel.</p>
<p>Invariably I was offered the solution of buying enough different daisy wheels so that I would have (almost all) the desired symbols at my disposal. But that solution is utterly unrealistic, for, when using a typewriter, I wish to compose the text at the keyboard, formulae and all. (If I did not compose at the keyboard, the use of the machine would cost time instead of saving it.)</p>
<p>I am however unable to do mathematics at the keyboard if</p>
<table width="453" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2">
<tr>
<td>(i)</td>
<td>a few vital symbols are lacking, and</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>(ii)</td>
<td>I would have to change daisy wheels a dozen times per line.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Unless I have all the symbols at my fingertips, the "solution" is unrealistic.</p>
<p>Do you think that as typewriter manufacturer you could manufacture the typewriter I need? If so, I would only be too pleased to specify my needs in the required detail. If my needs leave a few positions unused I shall be glad to assist you in the completion of the design.</p>
<p>Looking forward to your reply,</p>
