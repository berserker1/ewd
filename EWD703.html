<p class=noindent><b>A tutorial on the split binary semaphore</b>.
<p>The purpose of this note is threefold. It has been written to 
introduce the student to
<br>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the technique of the so-called &ldquo;split binary semaphore&rdquo; &mdash;originally
discovered, but at the same time not recommended, by C.A.R.Hoare&mdash;
<br>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the use of formal techniques in the development of multiprograms
<br>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the now canonical example of &ldquo;The readers and the writers&rdquo;, which the
student must know anyhow; it will be used as a carrier for the other two
purposes. The problem of the readers and the writers was designed by D.L.
Parnas.
<p>We consider two classes of cyclic processes, called &ldquo;readers&rdquo; and
&ldquo;writers&rdquo; respectively. with &ldquo;ncs&rdquo; standing for &ldquo;non-critical section&rdquo;,
they can be described by the programs
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%> reader: </td><td valign=top>
<b>do</b> true &rarr; ncs; READ <b>od</b></td><td align=right>(1)
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top> writer: </td><td valign=top>
<b>do</b> true &rarr; ncs; WRITE <b>od</b></td><td align=right>
</td>  </tr>  </table>
respectively. Here &ldquo;READ&rdquo; and &ldquo;WRITE&rdquo; denote their respective critical
sections, critical in the sense that when a writer is engaged in its critical
section, it must be <b>the only process</b> engaged in its critical section. This
problem can be solved in many different ways &mdash;the problem is canonical in
the sense that everybody proposing new synchronization primitives has solved
it in his way&mdash; , we shall now solve it using a split binary semaphore.
Our first step is the introduction of variables, in terms of which we
express our synchronization requirement formally; we call them &ldquo;ar&rdquo; and
&ldquo;aw&rdquo; &mdash;short for &ldquo;number of active readers&rdquo; and &ldquo;number of active writers&rdquo;
respectively&mdash; and consider the following multiprogram:
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td colspan = 2>
        ar = 0, aw = 0, mutex = 1           </td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan = 3>
reader: <b>do</b> true &rarr; ncs;          </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
           P(mutex); ar: ar + 1; V(mutex);  </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td>
           READ;                            </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td>
           P(mutex); ar: ar - 1; V(mutex)   </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td colspan = 2>
        <b>od</b>                           </td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan = 3>
writer: <b>do</b> true &rarr; ncs;          </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td>
           P(mutex); aw:= aw + 1; V(mutex); </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td>
           WRITE;                           </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td>
           P(mutex); aw:= aw - 1; V(mutex)  </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td colspan = 2>
        <b>od</b>                           </td> </tr>
</table>
<p>For multiprogram (2) the invariance of
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
P0:</td><td>ar &ge; 0 <b>and</b> aw &ge; 0
</td>  </tr>  </table>
follows immediately in the usual way &ldquo;from the topology of the program&rdquo;.
(Associate with reader<sub>i</sub> an additional variable c<sub>i</sub> , initially : 0, and
satisfying 0 &le; c<sub>i</sub> &le; 1 ; replace ar:= ar + 1 by c<sub>i</sub>, ar := 1, ar + 1 and
ar:= ar - 1 by c<sub>i</sub>, ar := 0, ar - 1 and observe the invariance of ar =
&Sigma;ci , etc.)
<p class=noindent><b>Note</b>. Looking at program (2) and interpreting it operationally, one might be
tempted to say: clearly ar &ge; the number of readers engaged in READ , and
as &rdquo;a number of readers&ldquo; is never negative, ar &ge; 0 follows immediately, and
similarly for aw &ge; 0 . I prefer not to do so, to prove the invariance of
P0 from the uninterpreted text (2), and to conclude from P0 that it does
not prohibit the interpretation of ar and aw as natural numbers. (End of
Note.)
<p>In terms of ar and aw I propose the required invariance of
P1: aw = 0 <b>or</b> (aw = 1 <b>and</b> ar = 0)
as a suitable formal expression of our operational requirement &rdquo;when a writer
is engaged in its critical section, it must be <b>the only process</b> engaged in
its critical section&ldquo;. The term aw = 0 is intended to cover the situation
when no writer is engaged in its critical section, the term aw = 1 <b>and</b> ar = 0
                
should cover the case when a writer is engaged in its critical section.
<p class=noindent><b>Note</b>. The attentive reader will already have decided that he should not 
expect more eloquence from me on the &ldquo;suitability&rdquo; of the proposal captured by
P1 . (End of Note.)
<p>In order to prevent ar:= ar + 1 from violating P1 we can make
it into a guarded command of the form
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
</td><td>wp(&ldquo;ar:= ar + 1&rdquo;, P1) &rarr; ar:= ar + 1 .
</td>  </tr>  </table>
The axiom of assignment gives for this guard
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
</td><td>aw = 0 <b>or</b> (aw = 1 <b>and</b> ar + 1 = 0)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
but on account of P0 the second term is false, and we simplify
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
</td><td>aw = 0 &rarr; ar:= ar + 1 .
</td>  </tr>  </table>
<p>In order to prevent aw:= aw + 1 from violating P1 we consider
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
</td><td>wp(&ldquo;aw:= aw + 1&rdquo;, P1) &rarr; aw:: aw + 1 .
</td>  </tr>  </table>
The axiom of assignment gives for this guard
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
</td><td>aw + 1 = 0 <b>or</b> (aw + 1 = 1 <b>and</b> ar = 0)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
but, again, P0 admits simplification of this guard &mdash;its first term is false&mdash;
and we find
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
</td><td>aw = 0 and ar = 0 &rarr; aw:= aw + 1 .
</td>  </tr>  </table>
The decrease ar:= ar - 1 is similarly guarded
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
</td><td>wp(&ldquo;ar:= ar - 1&rdquo;, P1) &rarr; ar:= ar - 1 ,
</td>  </tr>  </table>
and we get for the guard with the axiom of assignment
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
</td><td>aw = 0 <b>or</b> (aw = 1 <b>and</b> ar - 1 = 0) ,
</td>  </tr>  </table>
which, thanks to P1 can be simplified as
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
</td><td>aw = 0 &rarr; ar:= ar - 1 .
</td>  </tr>  </table>
The known invariance of P0 tells us that the precondition of ar:= ar - 1
                
implies wp(&ldquo;ar:= ar - 1&rdquo;, P0) , i.e. implies ar - 1 &ge; 0 ; on account of
P1 this implies aw = 0 , and, therefore, we can simplify to
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
</td><td>true &rarr; ar:= ar - 1
</td>  </tr>  </table>
i.e. the decrease ar:= ar - 1 need not be guarded at all.
<p>The verification that also aw:= aw - 1 need not be guarded is left
to the reader.
<p>Inserting the guards as derived we get
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=20%> initial state: </td><td valign=top>
ar = 0, aw = 0, mutex = 1</td><td align=right>(3)
</td>  </tr>  </table>

Multiprogram (3) has been designed so as to leave P0 <b>and</b> P1 
invariant, and that is fine. It has, however, a major drawback: both alternative
constructs, in the lines marked  and  respectively, may lead to 
abortion! The so-called split binary semaphore provides us with a technique for
preventing the selection of the critical sections marked  and  
respectively under those circumstances in which they would lead to abortion.
<p>We replace the single binary semaphore mutex by three, also binary,
semaphores &mdash; m , r , and w say&mdash; , related to the original mutex by
mutex = m + r + w ,
and replace in multiprogram (3) each P(mutex) by P(m), P(r), or P(w)
                     
&mdash;the three ways of decreasing mutex by 1&mdash; and each V(mutex) by V(m),
V(r), or V(w) &mdash;the three ways of increasing mutex by 1&mdash; . (Because
m, r, and w are semaphores, we thus guarantee 0 &le; mutex &le; 1 .) More 
precisely: we replace the P(mutex) marked by  by P(r) , replace the
P(mutex) marked by  by P(w) , and the P(mutex) that opens a critical
section that cannot lead to abortion by P(m) .
<p>We can now avoid selection of an aborting critical section by guarding
V(r) by aw = 0 and by guarding V(w) by aw = 0 <b>and</b> ar = 0 , because
the precondition of a V-operation on a component of a split binary semaphore
can be taken as the postcondition of the corresponding P-operation. Our
analysis so far would suggest that it suffices to replace V(mutex) everytime
by
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%> Q: </td><td valign=top>
<b>if</b> true &rarr; V(m) &#x25af; aw = 0 &rarr; V(r) &#x25af; aw = 0 <b>and</b> ar = 0 &rarr; V(w) <b>fi</b></td><td align=right>(4)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
<p>This, however, is too naive. To start with: how do we translate the
initialization mutex = 1 ? The initialization m = 0, r = 1, w = 0 is too
restrictive: if all readers remain in their ncs , no writer could perform
WRITE. The initialization m = 0 , r = 0, w = 1 has to be rejected on 
similar grounds. In order to make the only remaining possible initialization
m = 1, r = 0, w = 0 acceptable, readers and writers should encounter as
first P-operation one that cannot lead to abortion. We can satisfy this
requirement by inserting in both readers and writers of (3) after ncs
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
</td><td>P(mutex); V(mutex);
</td>  </tr>  </table>
before performing the substitution described above. This would lead to the
following multiprogram
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=20%> initial state: </td><td valign=top>
ar = 0, aw = 0, m = 1, r = 0, w = 0</td><td align=right>(5)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
<table> <tr> <td colspan = 3>
reader: <b>do</b> true &rarr; ncs; P(m); Q;      </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
                  P(r) {aw = 0}; ar:= ar + 1; Q; </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td>
                  READ;                          </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td>
                  P(m); ar:= ar - 1; Q           </td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td colspan = 2>

                  P(w) {aw = 0 an                </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td>
                  ar = 0}; aw:= aw + 1; Q;       </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td>
                  WRITE;                         </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td>
                  P(m); aw:= aw - 1; Q           </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td colspan = 2>

Multiprogram (5) is, however, still too naive: the non-determinacy, that has
been introduced by Q as given in (4), has lead to a system with the danger
of deadlock. The recipe for its prevention is, however, universal.
<br>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At initialization and at each V-operation, the &ldquo;type of the next 
operation&rdquo; &mdash;i.e. the component of the split binary semaphore on which this
program will perform its next P-operation&mdash; must be uniquely defined.
Our program (5) satisfies this condition, as do all programs without initial
non-determinacy nor non-determinacy between a V-operation and the dynamically
next P-operation. If a program does not satisfy this condition we can always
make it satisfying it by introducing one or more extra components of the split
binary semaphore, and by replacing essentially
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td colspan = 2>
       <b>if</b> true &rarr; P(component 1);... </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>&nbsp; </td> <td>
        &#x25af; true &rarr; P(component 2);... </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td colspan = 2>
       <b>fi</b>                                </td> </tr>
</table>
by
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td colspan = 2>
       <b>if</b> true &rarr; P(extra component); Q; P(component 1);... </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>&nbsp; </td> <td>
        &#x25af; true &rarr; P(extra component); Q; P(cpmponent 2);... </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td colspan = 2>
       <b>fi</b>                                                       </td> </tr>
</table>
<p class=noindent><b>Task</b>. Prove that for this substitution process only a finite number of 
different extra components is needed. (End of Task.)
<br>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with each component of the binary semaphore we associate a counter,
initialized to the number of processes for which the first P-operation is of
the corresponding type.
<br>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After each P-operation we insert a decrease by 1 of the counter 
associated with its type.
                 
<br>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before each Q we insert an increase by 1 of the counter associated
with the type of the dynamically next P-operation. (Thanks to step 1
this is a we11-defined counter.)
<p class=noindent><b>Note</b>. For the operationally minded each counter can be interpreted as the
number of processes &ldquo;ready&rdquo; or &ldquo;headed&rdquo; for a P-operation on the 
corresponding component. (End of Note.)
<br>5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strengthen in Q the guarding of each V(component) by the requirement
that the corresponding counter is positive.
<p>Associating with the semaphore components m , r , and w the counters
bm , br , and bw respectively, carrying out the above transformations on
program (5) leads to
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=20%> initial state: </td><td valign=top>

<b>Note</b>. The transformation of the introduction of the counters and of the
strengthening of the guards in Q by the requirement that the corresponding
counters be positive, excludes the danger of deadlock. If the original 
requirement &mdash;in our case: the invariance of P1&mdash; entailed intrinsically the
danger of deadlock, this danger is now made manifest by the danger of abortion
in Q . The systematic procedure for dealing with that situation falls 
outside the scope of this tutorial. (End of Note.)
<p>Our original system was free from deadlock, hence we must &mdash;see above
note&mdash; be able to prove the absence of the danger of abortion in Q . The
precondition of Q implies everywhere in (6)
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
      bm + br + bw = number of readers + number of writers </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>
      ar + br &le; number of readers                       </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>
      aw + bw &le; number of writers                       </td> </tr>
</table>
<b>Task</b>. Verify the above three assertions. (End of Task.)
<p class=noindent>From the above we conclude
<table> <tr> <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td> <td>
      ar + aw &le; bm , and hence                      </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>
      bm &gt; 0 <b>or</b> (ar = 0 <b>and</b> aw = 0) . </td> </tr>
</table>
Assuming the number of processes to be larger than zero &mdash;otherwise the danger
of abortion is absent anyhow!;&mdash; , we also have
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
</td><td>bm &gt 0 <b>or</b> br &gt; 0 <b>or</b> bw &gt; 0
</td>  </tr>  </table>
and from the last two relations it follows that at least one of the guards of
Q as given in (6&rsquo;) is true.
The above form of Q as given in (6&rsquo;) is still very non-deterministic:
we have the strategic freedom of strengthening the guards as long as we avoid
the danger of abortion. As it stands, our solution does not exclude that
readers or a writer are denied access to their critical section READ or
WRITE without reason. Within Q we can give &ldquo;priority&rdquo; to V(r) or V(w)
by strengthening the guard of V(m) to the conjunction of the complements of
the other two guards:
                
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
Am:</td><td>(aw &gt; 0 <b>or</b> br = 0) <b>and</b> (aw &gt; 0 <b>or</b> ar &gt; 0 <b>or</b> bw = 0)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
Denoting by Ar and Aw respectively:
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
Ar:</td><td> aw = 0 <b>and</b> br &gt; 0
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>
Aw:</td><td>aw = 0 <b>and</b> ar = 0 <b>and</b> bw &gt; 0
</td>  </tr>  </table>
we can new substitute for Q in (6)
<table width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=10%> Q: </td><td valign=top>
if Am &rarr; V(m) &#x25af; Ar &rarr; V(r) &#x25af; Aw &rarr; V(w) <b>fi</b> .</td><td align=right>(7')
</td>  </tr>  </table>
All (new superfluous) operations on bm can be omitted; using the 
postconditions of the P-operations, the substitution instances of Q as given
by (7&rsquo;) can be simplified. Thus we derive from (6) the multiprogram

<b>Remark</b>. An inspection of the alternative constructs in (7) shows that only
the very last one is non-deterministic: here we have, therefore, still a
strategic freedom. Investigate the consequences of replacing the last
guarded command bw &gt; 0 &rarr; V(w)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bw &gt; 0 <b>and</b> br = 0 &rarr; V(w) . (End of
Remark.)        
<p align="center" class="noindent">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>*</p> 
<p>In the above we have derived our final program as the end of a sequence
of successive versions. We have done so for educational reasons, with the
intent of introducing the different aspects of programs synchronized with
a split binary semaphore one after the other. This is not meant as a 
suggestion that in the case of actual program design one should write down all those
successive versions! The experienced programmer knows that &ldquo;outside the
critical sections&rdquo; as delineated by the P - V pairs, we have an invariant of
the form
<table width=100%><tr><td valign=top width=10%>
</td><td>(m = 0 <b>or</b> Am) <b>and</b> (r = 0 <b>or</b> Ar) <b>and</b> (w = 0 <b>or</b> Aw)
</td>  </tr>  </table>
and focusses his attention on the A&rsquo;s; having chosen them he derives the final
code. I make this remark because so-called &ldquo;program transformations&rdquo; are
sometimes suggested as a practical way of program derivation &mdash;not by me,
for as a rule it leads to an undue amount of writing&mdash; .
